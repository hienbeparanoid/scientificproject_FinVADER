18dolny,AMD AI Chip release - Up ~6.5% in the last 24hrs. Thoughts?,Su Bae will not disappoint us. She is always conservative with her estimates.,8
18dolny,AMD AI Chip release - Up ~6.5% in the last 24hrs. Thoughts?,I think and hope that both AMD and NVDA will be up significantly.  Long calls on both.,11
18dolny,AMD AI Chip release - Up ~6.5% in the last 24hrs. Thoughts?,"AMD just needs to take a small share of the AI market to boost their valuation, and they are the closest thing to Nvidia offering so far. Software support is always lacking in AMD, I won’t imagine they takeover the AI chips market like server chips,   and they will keep taking hits from “news” that MSFT/GOOG/AMZN are making their own. Overall it will be a very bumpy ride",5
18dolny,AMD AI Chip release - Up ~6.5% in the last 24hrs. Thoughts?,">The market response has been strong so far, but it remains to be seen how long it will last. OpenAI's use of the MI300X is a positive sign, but analyst predictions in June were pessimistic. I'm curious to see what other people think about this situation.",4

18dolny,AMD AI Chip release - Up ~6.5% in the last 24hrs. Thoughts?,"Stay the course; all-in. Look at the market cap of NVDA vs AMD. Companies need processing power. Clearly there's a better bang for the buck buying AMD. The chart looks incredible and can literally moon to new all-time-highs.

I'm in Jan $120 AMD calls - $50k so far:

18dolny,AMD AI Chip release - Up ~6.5% in the last 24hrs. Thoughts?,"I don't see how this is positive for $NVDA. 

Alphabet, AMD, MSFT and others are all spending big bucks on developing their own chips for AI and there's no way that's not eventually leaving a dent in NVDA's margins. I mean, that's the whole point. Not being dependent on the one company that tries to milk everyone.",3
18dolny,AMD AI Chip release - Up ~6.5% in the last 24hrs. Thoughts?,It's called Advanced Money Destroyer for a reason. Take profits now/soon. We will see under $100. This is financial advice.,3
18dolny,AMD AI Chip release - Up ~6.5% in the last 24hrs. Thoughts?,"long on AMD, easy +200$ stock",1
18dolny,AMD AI Chip release - Up ~6.5% in the last 24hrs. Thoughts?,shit’s gonna blow out very soon,1
18dolny,AMD AI Chip release - Up ~6.5% in the last 24hrs. Thoughts?,"I absolutely agree! The market is due for a correction, and poor people are going to be hit the hardest.",3
18dolny,AMD AI Chip release - Up ~6.5% in the last 24hrs. Thoughts?,The infinite rally lol,1
18dolny,AMD AI Chip release - Up ~6.5% in the last 24hrs. Thoughts?,It is bullish for NVDA because once people try the AMD chips they will regret it and buy NVDA chips later,5
