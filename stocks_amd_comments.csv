18d136b,$AMD shares up 8% following rollout of new MI300 AI chips,"""400 billion AI market"". That makes zero sense. The entire semiconductor market is declining and is $520 billion.

The entire semiconductor market is supposed to double in 4 years because of ""AI AI AI AI AI""?

Maybe if you reclassify the old semiconductor market as ""AI"" the math might work. It's not going to be a semiconductor market of $520 billion and a new ""AI"" market of $400 billion.",-5

18d136b,$AMD shares up 8% following rollout of new MI300 AI chips,The foundational LLMs will only get larger. But the smaller models derived from the foundational large models are quite good. However even the small models will grow in size as they get more sophisticated and the adoption grows.,7
18d136b,$AMD shares up 8% following rollout of new MI300 AI chips,Can you run an LLM on a personal device? No. This is dependent on how pervasive LLMs will become,2

18d136b,$AMD shares up 8% following rollout of new MI300 AI chips,"AMD offers pretty good consumer GPUs, if you're a Linux user like myself, going AMD is a no brainer. But when it comes to competing at the high end, AMD doesn't have the marketshare to do it. Because outspending Nvidia on the big monolythic GPU dies is a losing proposition.

Which is why AMD's chiplet strategy is key. 

Chiplets are difficult to pull off. This is because breaking up the GPU into chiplets introduces latencies. Which is particularly problematic for graphics as opposed to compute.

However bit by bit AMD has been innovating here, and a recent Patent suggests they have cracked the code. If they can scale chiplets in consumer graphics GPUs, this lowers the barrier of entry significantly. And we will for sure see some change there.",5
18d136b,$AMD shares up 8% following rollout of new MI300 AI chips,"AMD had good cards, but nVidia has better software and sadly software can be a massive money drain... I'd rather AMD focuses on things making money first and foremost, rather then chasing nVidia and burning themselves out.",4

18d136b,$AMD shares up 8% following rollout of new MI300 AI chips,"LLM inference doesn't need as much compute power to run as everyone thinks. But it needs fast HBM GPU memory.

18c7516,AMD or Intel—which is better as a long term investment?,And why not both?,27
18c7516,AMD or Intel—which is better as a long term investment?,"I would say both long term but I am trying to sell off all my AMD shares in the short term. I am also selling off Intel shares but that's because I have too much exposure to Intel. 

AMD has been delivering. They currently have the best product in client and data center segments. That said, they are not capturing market share as quickly as I expected and they don't seem to have enough volume to satisfy demand. There is also no straightforward path for them to increase production. Currently the rumor is that Apple and Intel both booked the bulk of TSMC's 3nm wafer capacity and there isn't much left for AMD. It's likely that at some point Intel will regain the node advantage, their next gen client lineup will mostly be fabricated by TSMC. 

On the TSMC front it also looks like they focused on the 3nm node when they were having yield problems for Apple. This likely means that Intel's 2nm node might be put the Intel fabs and TSMC at parity. TSMC also doesn't seem to be investing as aggressively as Intel to get next gen lithography machines. 

Intel on the other hand is consistently falling behind schedule but they are getting slightly better. The meteor lake product they are launching this month was delayed from being launched this summer to being launched mid December. They are also launching Emerald rapids at the same time and I am pretty interested in the uplift there. Their roadmap is aggressive and pretty exciting but again, they need to hit those dates and they aren't so far. That said, it does look like the deck will be stacked in their favor again. In the 80s Japan looked like it was going to dominate the semiconductor space and then Uncle Sam placed his toe on the scales which pretty much resulted in US dominance of the sector. Now semiconductor are seen as a matter of national security and it's unlikely that Intel will need to continue to compete on an unleveled playing field. TSMC and Samsung have much lower costs because Taiwan and South Korea both provide massive subsidies for them. US will likely be doing the same with the bulk of the subsidies coming in the form of labor force training while some will be direct subsidies. This will help level the playing field between Intel fabs and their competitors over the next decade. Personally I doubt Taiwan and South Korea will try to outdo the US on the subsidy front, we just have way more money to throw at national security than they do. That said, the Chips act money still has not been allocated so we don't know who will get what subsidies just yet.",27

18c7516,AMD or Intel—which is better as a long term investment?,"At this point, with how many companies are moving toward inhouse fabless design for their chips, intel's intended ""fab as a service"" business model may be a more future proof plan than AMD's fabless design. I've made a lot of money off AMD but the competitive landscape has been shifting against them there. If inhouse fabless design doesn't seem like something that will continue to work out for apple/google/amazon/microsoft or if you think that trend will stay niche, then I'd go for AMD as a company with stronger 1-3 year growth potential and profit margins. Intel's planned business model seems more compelling in this landscape but they still need to execute on it in a tough environment with high capital costs, so definitely gambling on turnaround there.

Maybe add SMH and QQQM slowly this year to diversify instead of concentrating here, things are changing a ton, and quickly, in the space.",7

18c7516,AMD or Intel—which is better as a long term investment?,"Intel is mature in a sense. But their foundry business is brand new and a big growth driver. Market for chips predicted to be $1 trillion per year by 2030. Intel aims to be second largest foundry with market share of ~30% of high end chips. No one knows if they will be successful, but TSMC won’t be able to build out enough capacity to meet all the demand and intel will win its fair share of business, I think. 

They don’t get talked about too much wrt AI, but their Guadi AI accelerators are promising. Gaudi 2 already outperforms the H100 in some AI tasks, but not most. Gaudi 3 is already coming out. They offer decent price to performance and it’s improving. 

Intel has room for growth because (1) its price to sales is compressed because it’s beat down. Multiple expansion if they have a successful turnaround will boost price. (2) they have foundry, Mobileye, AI accelerators and other growing segments. (3) the TAM for chips is growing fast and all foundries will be needed to meet demand.",0

They are not behind on chip design. Main difference is they are behind TSMC on process technology. AMD uses TSMC. 

Intel has a plan to hit five new nodes in 4 years. They have bad history of hitting deadlines, but under Gelsinger they have hit their timelines for these nodes so far. 

Their fab business won’t be competitive until they come out with 18A. That’s when their own chips should be back toward the top of performance/efficiency. 

All investing is a gamble, homie, in the sense that you are rewarded for taking risk. There is little upside on AMD at current price, because their businesses is running smoothly and their shares demand a premium multiple. 

Intel has partnered with ARM and will be fabbing ARM chips for customers. 

Investing is about looking forward, but you’re looking back and at current state. Intel stumbled majorly because they had a shit CEO that didn’t understand the design and manufacturing processes.  Now led by Gelsinger who is much better and focused on regaining process leadership. 

Again, if AMD is successful, they make good up 300% in ten years. Great returns. If Intel is successful, I think it can beat that return by a large margin.

Example:

You have 100. 50 goes to intel 50 goes to amd. Once a week on a random time you buy 1 dollar of each until your money is invested.

There is a reason it's IDM 2.0 and not IDM 1.0. Intel failed once already at doing the exact same thing.

> They are not behind on chip design. Main difference is they are behind TSMC on process technology. AMD uses TSMC. 

One of the long time competitive advantages was the fact that Intel has been able to tweak their process to have a tailor made process for their CPUs. So moving to TSMC for Intel will not be all roses. They will have to learn how to get the best performance without having all that secret sauce they developed at the in house fab over decades. 

Also architecturally speaking. AMD has leveraged the infinity fabric chiplet strategy much more effectively. So AMD has an advantage in architecture as well.

> Intel has partnered with ARM and will be fabbing ARM chips for customers. 

Commodity ARM chips are not a great revenue driver. Unless they can contract for Apple, it will pale in comparison to the cash TSMC is getting.

In the end, I do agree that Intel has a better upside, since they have been taking a beating for a long time. But that's not saying much unless they can turn it around. So far we've seen zero evidence of this.",4
18c7516,AMD or Intel—which is better as a long term investment?,"1) You show you don’t really understand intel. They aren’t doing the same thing. They are opening up their manufacturing to third party customers for the first time ever. IDM stands for integrated device manufacturer, meaning they design and manufacture their own chips. 

Most competitors went fabless. AMD spun out their manufacturing as Global Foundries. 

Most people think fabless is the way to go. It’s why AMD pulled ahead. They focus on what they do best and let someone else figure out the manufacturing. TSMC meanwhile gets to work with many customers with more volume and that helps their manufacturing prowess. 

Intel is trying a brand new strategy for them under Gelsinger. IDM 2.0 where they make other people’s chips for them. 

2) you’re wrong about being able to tweak their process being an advantage. It’s was a weakness. The design side got lazy thinking they could fix things later by tweaking the process. This leads to delays in your new nodes, undue costs, etc. It was abused so much Intel now separated the two lines of business so they have to account for their profitability individually. 

3) they are not going to TSMC. Not exactly. They will use their own fabs as much as possible. If TSMC has better tech for a portion of the chip they need, they will use TSMC. This is a new strategy too that they never would have done before. 

4) intel is late to the game on chiplets but they have moved to them now. Recognized the mistake and changed course. But they have their own unique interconnect with many advantages over infinity fabric

5) if Intel regains process lead or even parity with TSMC, they will win major customers like apple. Apple doesn’t want all its eggs on a tiny island 100 miles of the coast of China.",2

Also Purchase of Tower Semiconductor was believed to be instrumental in Intel doing it the right way by purchasing an existing IFS. But that sale couldn't go through due to China not approving it.

> Intel is trying a brand new strategy for them under Gelsinger. IDM 2.0 where they make other people’s chips for them. 

Yes. Like I said, they tried this once already. I'll believe it when I see it.

> you’re wrong about being able to tweak their process being an advantage. It’s was a weakness. 

I'm not wrong. Intel is famous for having unique metal layers in their process which in turn allow them to hit higher clocks. Intel's CPU clocks will regress when they switch to TSMC. AMD has had for longer to perfect their design to TSMCs PDK (Process Design Kits).

Both Intel's Design side and Fab side got lazy. Yes.

> 3) they are not going to TSMC. Not exactly. 

Well if this rumor is true, they are.

https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-will-spend-14-billion-on-manufacturing-chips-at-tsmc-report

> 4) .. But they have their own unique interconnect with many advantages over infinity fabric

You're thinking of Intel's EMIB. But you're mixing terms here. Infinity fabric is a logical fabric, nothing to do with physical interconnects and their packaging, like TSMC's CoWOS is analogous to EMIB.  When it comes to leveraging chiplets AMD are a clear leader in this area. They have been working on this for a long time. Breaking up compute into chiplets costs additional power, requires advanced caching hierarchies to hide introduced latency, infinity fabric which connects all the devices efficiently and AMD has mastered this tech over a number of generations, Infinity Fabric is on the 4th gen. 

This is all. Evidenced by the fact that AMD today has the fastest CPU (Epyc Genoa), and the fastest GPU (mi300x) in the world. Both leveraging chiplets. Powering the fastest and most efficient super computers in the world. Frontier and the upcoming El Capitain",4

There are quite specific times to sell and times to buy, but holding is always a good idea if the underlying company is able to turn a profit and has cash to burn through in case of an economic emergency. Interest rates are high so companies with not a lot of cash and big amounts of debt + high operating costs would be something I'd stay away from right now.

181xhis,"When is a good time to buy NVIDIA stocks, AMD and Intel?","Can’t recall every factor I use for RV, but there’s 10 for liquidity, 12 for operating, 8 for risk, 9ish for growth, 10ish for capital structure, and 20 for current valuation.  

And I base my DCF models on unlevered FCF.  I can check the specifics of my models when I’m back on a terminal tomorrow though. 


I think it’s easier, or more realistic at least, to determine what sectors will do well in the short term, which makes it simpler to narrow down the list of companies I’m looking at. For instance, I’m bullish on energy & info tech atm, so I’ll determine subsectors of each I’m confident in (semis are one such subsector), then run a relative valuation of companies in that subsector. That RV model ranks the companies based on the weighted aforementioned factors (Liquidity, operating etc).  Then I’ll do a deep dive on individual companies in the top quartile or so of that refined list and determine 12m price targets.  

So when I do the deep dive on each company I look at everything I can. The starting list is the last few years 10-Ks, proxy statements, everything management has said or published over the last three years, last two earnings calls (minimum), investor and earnings presentations, company specific news, financials for the last 20 years, 10 years, 5 years, 2 years to gauge momentum and historical trends unique to the company and where they trade.  Management is a big point for me too, so I’ll look into who’s in the C-Suite, what experience they have, what they’ve accomplished at their previous company, what they’ve accomplished at the company I’m valuing, and general leadership ability.  That’s probably more info than you want but it’s a pretty good idea of what I look at and how I move from idea to taking a position.",1

17kx3vb,"AMD beats earnings estimates, misses Q4 guidance","Lots of things can happen over the next couple months.

Supposedly those chips are in production so maybe sales start sooner or sell better.  Or maybe sales get delayed ever further.  

Maybe they'll make weak in-roads against NVIDIA, or maybe the opposite.  

Maybe reviews for them will be glowing, maybe they won't.  

Maybe there's some price battling, maybe not.

Maybe a trade ban hits them sooner instead of later.  

There's really so much not known until they really start delivering these.  

Of course the Sesquihana analyst covering them is lowering PT... but from $145 to $130.  So is it positive that he expects a 35% rally?  Or is it negative that he's cut PT by 10%?  It's all really a toss up.

Realizing that the actual facts and fundamentals and news for AMD haven't changed one iota since it was recently at $130 is interesting.  

Is it at a great buying opportunity, or was the $130 level a delusion?",6
