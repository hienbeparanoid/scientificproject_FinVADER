17s8uuv,Microsoft $MSFT at all time high!,It's unchristian.,2
17s8uuv,Microsoft $MSFT at all time high!,"Sure. I realize everyone's valuation models are a little different.

I have a couple ways of doing it, but the simplest to explain for filtering supremely overvalued stocks is this. I basically ask the question: could this company deliver more distributable cashflow to me as a shareholder over the next 10 years than a bond of similar safety.

So, let's say we're looking at MSFT. I would compare to 10+ year A-rated corporate bonds (roughly 5.5% right now) or Treasury bonds (4.6% right now). I take 75% of MSFT earnings yield (no company can distribute 100% of earnings yield, and even 75% is very high that would pretty much eliminate growth), and then I check to see what type of annual earnings growth would have to be achieved in order for my equity portfolio to equal the portfolio growth of the bond portfolio. Right now, MSFT has an earnings yield of 2.8%. So, starting year one as though we were actually getting 75% of this (2.1%), I then see how much annual growth we would have to achieve to equal roughly 5.5% from bonds. In this particular example, we would need 20% growth annualized over 10 years for our MSFT account to equal A-rated corporate bonds. 15% growth would equal a bond portfolio of roughly 4.3% over the next 10 years.

The interpretation is this: MSFT would have to distribute 75% of their earnings as dividends (they presently distribute 25%) AND grow their earnings at 20% per year in order for us to receive the same cashflow as A-rated corporate bonds over the next 10 years. If we add in the fact that MSFT stock could lose valuation, whereby those holding the stock could have capital losses, I just don't see the bullish argument in support of MSFT stock right now.

I have several other techniques to value a company, but the conclusion is the same. MSFT would need sustained high growth and no multiple contraction for the stock to be worth it at the present valuation.",2

Just because you know the general idea of how it works doesn't mean it cannot ""think"". We also know how human brain works generally, by communicating across neurons with chemicals. But you do not say ""therefore it cannot really understand or think"".

The large foundational models are displaying very unexpected emergent abilities, which, we actually do not fully understand.

Coming to maths, can you do simple arithmetic accurately and fast like your calculator? No because neural networks aren't very good at that. The foundational models are emulating your thinking structure, not a calculator's. You (or someone in your species) on the other hand can carry or abstract thinking to formulate or propagate advanced math, connect it to real life, etc. which Wolfram Alpha cannot do - nor any classical software can.

No one is feigning competence at anything.  Nigel is competent at scrabble, which is why he is able to win at scrabble. The 'fundamental understanding' you're asking for is simply a different task from the one he's completing.  


>the same way chess moves have been discussed as nauseum

But what makes a good move is highly dependent on the precise configuration of pieces.  General principles of chess break down far before .  the level of play that ChatGPT is able to achieve.  It's not simply applying the basic rules it knows from reading about them, it is taking multiple conflicting chess principles and somehow intelligently picking the most salient ones \*for that unique position.\*  This is a very hard and impressive task for something that hasn't been trained to do so.

>ChatGPT can't play chess

If it can't play chess, then how come it can play chess so well?  If a robot were  to 'outrun' a human, would you say ""it can't run, because to run is to have awareness that you are a human putting one foot in front of another etc. etc. but no this machine simply executes a series of mechanical movements that it doesn't \*really\* understand in order to do the some motions and cross the finish line before the human so it's not \*really\* running"".  I'm not so interested in that.... it can play chess because it plays chess.",3

You're demonstrating some very fundamental misunderstanding about what a LLM actually is. 

A LLM is not a general AI, it is not even a ""baby-general AI"". 

Imagine the Library of Babel that has every imaginable combination of English alphabets in its system, it has Macbeth in it and poems not yet written but you wouldn't say the Library has written literature. ChatGPT can say the words that makes it sound like it understand because of a combination of supervised learning and RLHF. 

A chess engine actually uses search and evaluate functions and has endgame tables to process and evaluate moves as it develops. A LLM doesn't do that, it just process...okay I'm just repeating myself at this point. Arguing that more is like arguing with someone who thinks a car moves because there are little horses in the front instead of the internal combustion that takes place. I should just delete this but I've written so much already. Take it, read it, debate it, I don't care anymore.",2

You are probably right that windows based (Apple influenced) products are not going away for the next two decades but for an operating system that is used by the masses, I prefer Apple over microsoft or android. I wouldn't be surprised if AI develops a better operating system then we currently have.  Go buy microsoft if that makes you happy.",1
17s8uuv,Microsoft $MSFT at all time high!,"I have enough humility and curiosity to consider that I might be wrong, unlike you, but I'm also competent enough at reasoning and informed enough on this subject (as a software engineer and chess player) to see that your analogies are poor, most of your statements are beside the point, and your entire argument is to basically beg the question with the word 'fake' and then pretend like this isn't just semantics/philosophy.  


>using language to persuade people it understand something

No. It's using \*good chess moves\* to demonstrate this.  If it beat the world champion you'd be all 'nah it's just tricking you! It's actually really bad at chess!"" Or maybe you just don't understand the difficulty of playing as well as it currently is.  


>A LLM is not a general AI, it is not even a ""baby-general AI"".

It's sure a good thing that I never said otherwise and this has nothing to do with the question at hand.  


>it has Macbeth in it and poems not yet written but you wouldn't say the Library has written literature

Another completely off the mark analogy. This is like saying ChatGPT plays 1 trillion chess games, some of which are good, means it's good at chess.  Of course that's nonsense but that's also absolutely not what's happening.  


>A chess engine actually uses search and evaluate functions and has endgame tables to process and evaluate moves as it develops. A LLM doesn't do that

I love how you consider search and evaluation functions to be authentic understanding unlike 'fake' understanding of LLM.  So if ChatGPT coded some search and evaluation functions and used them to play chess, then suddenly it wouldn't be faking it anymore?  There's philosophical point about knowledge to be made somewhere in there, but you sure aren't making it.",2
17s8uuv,Microsoft $MSFT at all time high!,But what's your point? If it walks like a duck and talks like a duck then it's a duck. Do we even know what general AI looks like and if it's attainable?

17t23sz,Taking out all my money from VOO and dumping it into MSFT,"Assuming this is a serious question, there's obvious issues whether you do or you don't.  

I'm doubtful this is a true portfolio, as you'd need to have been doing a lot of active buying and selling to just happen on those very round numbers.  

It's also highly sector concentrated and thus non-diverse.  Plus there's redundancies in the fact VOO would contain all the individual names also.  

Essentially you'd be making a move that's traditionally not recommended, and for taking that risk, you only stand to potentially benefit a slice of a slice of increment.  And that's assuming it works out.  

That said, I'm an advocate of motivated and dedicated individuals holding a basket of individual stock names.  That absolutely can produce better results than indexes.  However it requires, as already mentioned, a lot of active management and attention and discipline and skill.  

You're essentially being your own fund manager at that point.  And it's like being a zookeeper.  No days off, ever.  Constant attention and researching and tracking.  Need to be available to make trades as required.  This amounts to a certain number of hours per day.  So if you're doing this so that your $10,000 portfolio can return $1,000 this year instead of $700, you might be spending 300 hours to (potentially) capture $300.  That's $1/hour for your time.

But if you're doing it on a $1 million portfolio, and it nets you $30,000 better results, that $30,000 for 300 hours is $100/hour.  At that scale, being your own full time fund manager becomes more compelling.",2
17t23sz,Taking out all my money from VOO and dumping it into MSFT,"I personally wouldn't recommend it.

Microsoft is a great company and I don't see them going bankrupt anytime soon, but due to the sky high valuation of MSFT the likliehood of it going higher and higher for the immediate future is low.

The diversification of VOO is great at maintaining value and being less volatile. Making MSFT 40% of your portfolio is a bit pigeon holed.

Also it looks like your individual holdings are just more SP500 heavyweights.

You might want to consider some diversification. 

If you want to stay US maybe look at an ETF for medium or small cap funds.

But if it were me, I'd say move the money from VOO to something like VXUS.

International is very undervalued relative to the US, meaning it has a greater likliehood of big gains in the long term.

17t23sz,Taking out all my money from VOO and dumping it into MSFT,"MSFT is probably good for almost 500 and then back down. I’m guessing the likely range for MSFT in the next 3 years is 350-500. The up we’re seeing now with MSFT seems uncharacteristic for this time of year. 

MSFT has outperformed VOO in the previous 1-3-5-10 year ranges significantly, but we might be near the end of that. 

I’ll be moving partly out of MSFT just beyond 400 to pay for a remodel, but I’ll be holding the rest until I die. 

I would not buy MSFT now, I would wait for it to break down below 300. If you wait for it to hit <225 again you might not ever get there.",1

If you do fundamental analysis, their chance of future growth isn't that big. They trade often at high valuations, just because they are big.

VOO Holdings:

AAPL - 6.96%

MSFT - 6.49%

Googl - 2.15%

INTC - 0.41%

AMZN - 3.19%

On top of that, many of their products are continually getting worse instead better.

YouTube's recommendation are so terrible these days I've started using the algorithm-less subscriptions tab. Google Chrome lost it's best-in-class status 5+ years ago.

One of the things that fascinates me is how such a behemoth of a company grew to that size without making anything. I have never owned a physical product made by google. They are far from market leaders in the enterprise sector (AWS, Azure, Salesforce) but yet their business productivity suite continue to chug along. I have never paid for youtube and haven't paid a dime for my gmail account that is old enough to apply for a driver's license. It boggles my mind how much money a search engine, user data collection and targeted ad revenue can balloon. Truly some peak consumerism sht.

People have said I'm crazy for this take, but what would google do in a recession? A real recession or even prolonged stagflation. The first thing that falls is the advertising industry. If you think about it Google doesn't produce or own much of anything that isn't completely codependent on advertising revenue. People I've had this thought experiment with are quick to say that google owns the biggest media content platform ever. They aren't wrong, that ship could drink a lot of water before it would ever sink, but that platform has been a cash cow only by the merciful teet of advertising dollars. Google no doubt must know this. I think their recent initiative in attempt to get in on the short video format space that no one wants and even more recent initiative to convert users with Adblockers on youtube to convert them in to premium subscribers could be a tell future projections on what was once reliable revenue streams might be slowing down. By no means do I think google would be doomed they are a lot more than just youtube, but from an investing standpoint I could never justify entering a position after the great slingshot of covid 19. It has always been a respected company in the sector, but it was never the overhyped tech stock just a solid fundamental growth stock. Would love to hear what others think",1

First and foremost, at the consumer level we have a watered down version of utilizing current advancements in AI for our own musings through things like ChatGPT, Dall-E, etc.

I do not think that this is where the market is heading, but giving plebs like us a few new toys to mess with isn't creating any real harm.

Most big tech companies have what would be considered just a couple decades past a monopoly. The reason we don't hear much of startups in this space is they are literally just acquired and gobbled up by the big players in the space as soon as something innovative hits the market. Apple is acquiring companies at a rate of about 90 per annum, you can view Google's more recent acquisitions [on Wiki](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mergers_and_acquisitions_by_Alphabet) which details a severe market uptick in AI, analytics, and robotics.

Unless you are an ""insider"" you probably won't hear too much on these advancements, as big tech acquires most of these companies before they come to market for an end user.

If you want to look at what technologies AI is being used for, look no further than CIA funding. Palantir is a decent example of a CIA funded startup that is now publicly traded.

You can also look at a CIA finance arm's offerings [here](https://www.iqt.org/portfolio/). Occasionally looking at the startups there, a certain air of dystopian future can arise.

Big data, big analytics, and big surveillance are a despot's wet dream, and as more developing nations increase internet access for their populations, these tools will become even more pervasive.

Not all redundancies in big tech will come directly from AI, but automation of historically human jobs is certainly in the pipeline. One needs to look no further than their local supermarket in the western world to see machines fulfilling the past roles of cashiers. 

It is speculated that Microsoft is using individual user data to train it's [AI models](https://mspoweruser.com/personal-data-to-train-ai/) after a recent change in their privacy policy.

While we may not see the ramifications of these moves for a couple years, it's safe to assume that big tech wielding such an extensive collection of user data that can be parsed through AI models is going to be seriously fucking lucrative, likely at the expense of the general public.

If you want a glimpse of the dystopian promiseland envisioned by big tech and government, check out Henry Kissinger and former Google CEO Eric Schmidt's book ""The Age of AI.""

Activision Blizzard King is not the ""primary supplier"" for the games sector. Far from it.

Microsoft is not having a monopoly position in any form in the gaming market. Their Xbox consoles are being outsold 2:1 by Sony and 4:1 by Nintendo. On PC their Xbox Store is so far behind Steam it's not even a competition, despite Microsoft pushing the Xbox app there directly in the OS.

On mobile Microsoft has almost no presence in gaming before they acquired King, which has the popular Candy Crush, but little else.

The gaming revenue from Microsoft is including multiplatform titles like Minecraft, which is by far their most played game.

Your numbers do not match up. You are comparing the ""global gaming console market"" and then throw in numbers from Microsoft at 16.3 billion which would include subscriptions, multiplatform sales and PC sales. And even in this example, Microsoft in 2022 was 40% behind PlayStation (which would mostly have console market revenue).

**Activision Blizzard Acquisition by Microsoft**  
Both the United States' Federal Trade Commission and the United Kingdom's Competition and Markets Authority challenged the merger as anticompetitive and initiated legal procedures in their respective countries. In the United States, the acquisition was reviewed by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), as the agency had raised more concerns over mergers and acquisitions in the Big Tech sector in the last decade. Some U.S. Senators also expressed their concerns about the merger to the FTC. As part of the FTC's investigation, it was stated that both companies have ""failed to protect the rights of consumers"" and that the merger should be opposed if ""the transaction is likely to enhance monopoly power, and also worsen the negotiating position between workers and the parties."" The FTC formally stated its intention to block the acquisition as proposed on December 8, 2022. The FTC expressed concern that the acquisition would harm consumers of Activision Blizzard's games, and give Microsoft too much control of certain parts of the industry, such as cloud gaming. The FTC also pointed to the acquisition of Zenimax, which the FTC claimed that Microsoft had agreed to a concession from the European Union to not make their games exclusive to the Xbox, and later broke.   
The courts granted the temporary restraining order on June 13, 2023, while a hearing to determine if a preliminary injunction on the deal should be granted was held from June 22 to 30, 2023, before Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley. Microsoft said that if the injunction should be granted, they may consider abandoning the deal which they described as being a ""three-year administrative nightmare"". During the hearing, the FTC was focused on the effect of Call of Duty in the competitive market, console exclusivity, and the impact of the nascent cloud gaming field.  
The FTC formally withdrew its challenge to the acquisition on July 20, 2023, though they have announced their intent to refile at a later time. The FTC reopened its case against the merger on September 27, 2023, but then declined to block the merger from occurring.",0

**Sony Earnings**   
Sony’s (NYSE: SONY) PlayStation division generated **$26.9 billion in revenue** throughout **FY221 (period ending 3/2022**). This was driven predominantly by PlayStation 5 console sales, which had shipped a strong 19 million units in FY221. The total cumulative PS5 sales by March 2023 were 38.4 million.  
Sony, the Japanese electronics and entertainment giant, Friday reported full year results for the 12-month period from April 2022 to March 2023 showing group sales rising 16% to JPY11.5 trillion in local currency terms and net profits up 6% to JPY937 billion.

**Activision Blizzard Acquisition by Microsoft**  
Both the United States' Federal Trade Commission and the United Kingdom's Competition and Markets Authority have challenged the merger as anticompetitive and have initiated legal procedures in their respective countries. In the United States, the acquisition was reviewed by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), as the agency had raised more concerns over mergers and acquisitions in the Big Tech sector in the last decade. Some U.S. Senators expressed their concerns about the merger to the FTC. As part of the FTC's investigation, it stated that both companies have ""failed to protect the rights of consumers"" and that the merger should be opposed if ""the transaction is likely to enhance monopoly power, and also worsen the negotiating position between workers and the parties."" The FTC formally stated its intention to block the acquisition as proposed on December 8, 2022. The FTC expressed concern that the acquisition would harm consumers of Activision Blizzard's games, and give Microsoft too much control of certain parts of the industry, such as cloud gaming. The FTC also pointed to the acquisition of Zenimax, which the FTC claimed that Microsoft had agreed to a concession from the European Union to not make their games exclusive to the Xbox and later broke.   
The courts granted the temporary restraining order on June 13, 2023, while a hearing to determine if a preliminary injunction on the deal should be granted was held from June 22 to 30, 2023, before Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley. Microsoft said that if the injunction should be granted, they may consider abandoning the deal which they described as being a ""three-year administrative nightmare"". During the hearing, the FTC was focused on the effect of Call of Duty in the competitive market, console exclusivity, and the impact of the nascent cloud gaming field.  
The FTC formally withdrew its challenge to the acquisition on July 20, 2023, though they have announced their intent to refile at a later time. The FTC reopened its case against the merger on September 27, 2023, but now declined to block the merger from occurring.",1

18fn1n6,I believe Microsoft (MSFT) is prepping Lumen (LUMN) for an acquisition.,"Lumen and Microsoft would be an incredibly bad fit. Management is largely happy keeping the lights on (I've done work with them, and have seen how they wouldn't splash water on themselves if they all caught on fire).

Lumen is a service provider. Full stop. They are on legacy architecture and are terrified of modernizing (again, I've worked with them before). To call them ""extremely risk averse"" would be the understatement of the century. They have made literally no movement on getting off of their legacy platform that literally everyone on the board wants to get off of.

Microsoft's entire Enterprise GTM is centered around Partners doing the work. Buying Lumen would undermine that to the massive partner community they've spent decades building up. If Microsoft were to go down this route, they'd buy a lean company that wasn't literally terrified of moving forward. Buying Lumen would be the equivalent of buying a farm to raise horses after seeing Ford release the Model T. This entire thing sounds like the Co-CEO offering to give away half a million Blackberry's to undermine the release of the iPhone (deal was turned down).

I want to be clear, theres plenty of brilliant people that I've loved working with at Lumen. But the corporate structure is so rigid, that they can't put one foot in front of another. I have made strong friendships there.

I love Lumen. But why would Microsoft end their GTM play for decades to buy a company that can't chew gum and walk? This would be worse than them buying Nokia by high multipliers.

I'm sorry if that was rough. Sometimes the truth needs to be said.

With all of that said, I think the board does want to chop the company up into parts and sell it all off. I've heard far too much about a refusal to create a game plan to fix things.",3

18fn1n6,I believe Microsoft (MSFT) is prepping Lumen (LUMN) for an acquisition.,"In comparison, however, the equity ratio has been rising since 2019 and is recovering. Additionally, the equity ratio is not a conclusive item, as it must be evaluated depending on the industry. Moreover, it is highly unreliable since equity can be composed not only from the stated balance sheet positions but also from hidden reserves.

Asset Coverage Ratio 2:

In theory, a high level of long-term debt isn't necessarily negative if there is a maturity match with the useful life of long-term assets.

Asset Coverage Ratio 2: (10,437 + 30,341) / 40,161 = 1.0154 = 101.54%

Only when the value falls below 100% should concerns arise as it could indicate that repayment of short-term loans may cause liquidity constraints.

Regarding objections to Lumen's liquidity situation: Unfortunately, I only have figures for the total 'current assets' without a specific breakdown of its composition. Hence, I can only refer to the quick ratio and obtain the following values:

2021: 11,536 / 7,169 = 1.6092 = 160.92%

2022: 5,420 / 4,803 = 1.1285 = 112.85%

Desirable values range between 120-150%, which cannot be achieved in 2022.

However, this indicator from my side is also hardly conclusive since it's not apparent how much monetary current assets Lumen actually has available.

But what truly interests us all is the interest on the debt concerning our heavily indebted company.

Given the total capital return of -3.4%, I can insert this into the formula to determine the EBIT in connection with the total capital.

\-0.034 = EBIT / 45,581 = -1,549.754 EBIT

EBT: -991

Interests: -1,549.754 + 991 = -558.754

558.754 / 35,144 = 0.0159 = 1.60% interest rate... but this somehow seems incorrect.

In the 10k you also learn that Lumen has system issues internally because they are still using legacy infrastructure to facilitate these deals. Most of their expenditure is bringing these work tools up to date. 

A great example of the impacts of legacy systems would be Southwest and their legacy system shutting them down.

Kate took over a sinking ship, cut the dead weight, is streamlining the UX, and needs to improve the employee experience.

Once these are completed Lumen has the network, accounts, and the physical infrastructure to allow Microsoft to easily handle the massive growth of 5G, AI, gaming and every other buzzword there is.

Will Microsoft purchase the whole package, probably not, will Lumen likely sell those pieces off in the near future; we’ll see. This is a post speculating a business with $40B in Assets, $20B in debt, and $17B of annual revenue leaning its expenditure because it lost $1.5B last year.
