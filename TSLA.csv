2. Jack Ma walked back his stock sale after the criticism and downward trend of BABA.
3. BABA still leads with Alipay, yes the retail aspect is losing market share. Do note that these other companies are offering discounts after discounts to get market share. Once the discounts are gone how can you undercut BABA?
4. BABA as a whole might not be around 5 years later, but the payment system is hard to beat in China when digital wallets are the normal. BABA allows you to use foreign account digitally to pay when in China. The Chinese do not jump ship that easily, hence why Apple Pay is not super popular in China. Alipay has a Google like effect in China and has more room to run. 
5. Jack Ma will not let his company fail, he’s acting in the shadows for his family’s safety. He’s still calling the shots at BABA and biding his time.
6. BABA is a hold until after 2027 when the next election occurs .",2

2) It’s hard to see how the dividend yield of less than 2% for the Chinese-based company is going to attract income investors when they have much better risk-free alternatives closer to home.
3) At the same time, the buyback program has been ongoing since 2021, but that didn’t stop the shares from depreciating even more. 
4) The founder Jack Ma is leaving Alibaba
5) The negative market reaction to Alibaba’s latest earnings results indicates that the new geopolitical reality with heightened macro risks will continue to be more important for investors than the company’s fundamentals. What’s more, is that it appears that there’s nothing that the company’s management can do to change the situation.

Because of that, investors are scared, and the price of BABA has been driving down, down, down. It reached a point that I think is nearish to the bottom, (could go down to ~60, though) and I want to see what the next 5 years brings when the world inevitably makes amends (or goes to war) and makes it work like we usually do.

Okay. You are saying Twitter turned a profit for a couple of years and not others because of legal troubles. This was during the biggest economic boom in recent memory. 0% ffr, everyone trapped in their houses increasing Internet usage, and lots of helicopter money. Now it's been a year and the script has flipped. We have a 5% ffr and economic conditions are restrictive. What kind of quarterly loss are they taking right now? 

>His other companies are successful because they've attracted great talent and then built up a layer of management to manage Elon - run with his good ideas and ignore his bad ideas. 

This could very well be true. I don't work directly for him so I have no idea. That said, whatever methodology he uses, it's been extremely successful. 


>He is like a virus, and those companies had time to grow an immune response to him.

Don't think this is a fair statement.  Virus implies he is net negative. If that was the case and companies were being successful despite him damaging, then ceo would be a meaningless position. Why aren't other companies pulling Jon Does off the street to build trillion dollar companies... Why is it that whenever he gets involved, amazing companies are built...

>At Twitter, he fired all of the experts and he's just flailing around digging the hole deeper.

You mean he cut all the fat and brought out his own software people to review the product? Did he cut to much initially? Yes. Was this type of change needed for success? Also yes. The company was hemorrhaging money. 


At the end of the day, I'm very happy that he was willing to take the platform over. He has provided a town square that might not be perfect, but is far better than anything else around.

275,175fio1,"Hello, please look at my Tsla and nvda calls, they are way above strike but worth almost nothing, why is that?","I only read a few comments so in case you haven’t figured it out yet or gotten the answer:

You are buying the right to execute a contract that says you can buy 100 shares of TSLA at $260. You want to do this because you think the price of the stock itself will go up but since you are buying the contract ahead of time, there’s always the possibility that you’ll be right. That possibility is called time value and since the person selling you the contract is in it to make money, they are gonna charge you for that time value. 
So you are buying the contract with real money and the contract is priced based on how likely the market thinks it is that TSLA will go up in price and by how much. 
The price you pay for the contract is not the actual purchase of any stock, and when it comes time to buy the stock, the cost to do that is completely different than the cost of the contract. You don’t HAVE to execute the contract and purchase the 100 shares of TSLA per contract, but if it goes up in price, you want to. You DO however have to pay for that contract (upfront) and you never get that money back. What that means, is that if you want to make money by buying an option, the stock price has to go up enough to outweigh the cost of buying at the set contract (strike) price. Here is an example or two:
Profit) 1 TSLA $260 strike call. Contract cost $80. TSLA stock goes to $265. On expiration, you execute the option to buy 100 shares at $260 and immediately sell them at $265. $500 profit minus the $80 for the contract = $420 profit (nice)

Break even) 1 TSLA $260 strike call. Contract cost $80. TSLA stock goes to $260.80. You can execute, buy the 100 shares at $260, and immediately sell at $260.80 for an $80 profit but you know where I’m going with this. The profit is eaten by the initial cost and you walk away unscathed. (Note that even if the stock price only got as high as $260.70, it would still be worth executing because your losses would then only be $10

Loss) 1 TSLA $260 strike call. Contract cost $80. You messed up and bought the option on the same day as I bought TSLA stock so of course TSLA crashed. At expiration, the stock price is $230. You don’t want to execute, because you would have to buy at $260 and then what? You could just buy them without a contract now for $230. 

Cost per option contract divided by 100 plus strike price = your break-even point.

Note that you can also make money with options by buying them, holding them until the stock price goes up signaling good things to come (increase in time value) and then sell the contract for a profit. This is dangerous because time value decreases with each passing hour and day. 

Profits are unlimited on calls, losses are limited to the amount you paid for the contract(s)
The opposite is true for puts. Unlimited losses. Don’t do this.

Hope this is helpful and good luck!",1

283,175fio1,"Hello, please look at my Tsla and nvda calls, they are way above strike but worth almost nothing, why is that?","Check the options Delta. Delta measures how much the option's price will react to changes in the price of the underlying share. Delta goes from 0 to 100, 100 meaning that 1 dollar move in the underlying will translate to 1 dollar price move in the option, delta of 50 = 1$ move in the underlying moves the option 0.5$ and so on. Delta can also be seen as rough estimate (in %) of the option expiring in the money. Delta will rise in the money and fall out of the money. These changes in delta are called gamma. The less time to expiration, the higher is your gamma (unless you're deep in or out the money). Gamma has a flip side though, it comes with theta - i.e. time value depreciation. The higher your gamma, the higher your theta. Unless you go for smah & grab trades, i would roll the option 1m before expiry to the next, as theta will eat a higher portion of your extrinsic value the closer you get to expiry. (Imagine 20 days left, each day costs you 5%. Only 3 days left, each day costs you 33%) And then there's vega, that's how your option reacts to changes in implied volatility. This is especially relevant for in & at the money options with some duration. The higher the implied volatility, the more expensive option, the larger the move required to actually make money from buying the option. You may also wanna look into spreads, e.g. buying a call with a lower strike and selling one with a higher strike. Or buying a put with a higher strike and selling a put with a lower strike. Divide the difference between strikes by the difference in premium (that you pay on a net basis) to see your maximum return, e.g. 10$ strike diff / 2.5$ premium = you 4x your 'investment' when the option expires at or above your higher short call or at or below your lower put.",1
284,175fio1,"Hello, please look at my Tsla and nvda calls, they are way above strike but worth almost nothing, why is that?","Based on your comments - you aren't familiar with how buyers of call options price them. There are concepts of time decay and marginal profit that are at play here. For one - the breakeven on the calls you bought is as follows: Cost/100 + strike price. In essence, you have to cover the strike price and the derivative premium to be profitable. The share price being at or near the strike price is bad news with only a week or two left to create intrinsic value. There are lots of other factors to analyze for call options to determine their worth. Ultimately - I would recommend you do a lot of research on this area of the market before buying any more options.",1
285,175fio1,"Hello, please look at my Tsla and nvda calls, they are way above strike but worth almost nothing, why is that?",The real answer to your question is because premiums are expensive.

Except it means the car is 10 grand more expensive than it needs to be and they struggle to sell even half their inventory.

Sure it’d be nice  to have extra range as an option for the Teslas but it would have to be significantly more costly for a car that will be inferior in many ways.

491,16b72u1,Mercedes unveils new electric concept cars with better range than any Tesla model. Puts on TSLA?!,"Who are you crying for/protecting with this subliminally Pro Tesla persuasive essay?

The market of people requiring to drive a fully loaded vehicle with an overall lower GVWR (gross vehicle weight when fully loading an electric vehicle vs an ICE vehicle) is much much higher than you realize but you're either too inexperienced to see the whole market or again trying to persuade the reader with a very biased and delusional opinion of typical driver wants and needs.

Yes, more batteries equals more range depending how you decide to design an electric vehicle, there are enough spaces to install more batteries, change the vehicle weight vs towing capacity vs on board carrying capacity to the point that you're basically driving a battery on wheels... kind of defeats the purpose of having a truck,  or van, or semi truck whose only purpose is to deliver as much as possible and carry as heavy a load as possible within safety laws and regulations based on that vehicles GVWR.

Your opinion completely ignores professional movers, delivery, taxi, logistics in general. It leaves out the fact that developing a different battery that is lighter in weight and offers a more dense charge and thus more range at less weight so a delivery driver can continue their long, strenuous route that may require more range due to heavier towing loads requiring more from the vehicle both ICE or electric,  heavy loaded vehicles towing or even a passenger filled electric car driving long distance may not make it the full ""estimated"" distance, may not even come close with Tesla currently being sued and investigated for faking range numbers among various other issues they're having both legally and transparently.

Mercedes also is delivering a realistic electric semi truck at a realistic price based on current competition in the ev sector, I mean be real Tesla and Elon Musk sort of created a little monopoly on the vision of electric cars and with the help of people like you down playing just how complicated the entire production of electric vehicles really is, from how much it costs to build a fleet of long range electric trucks capable of performing at the same level as their ICE similarly weighted and sized counterparts (Ford Lightning vs Fords other trucks of similar weight and size probably offer insanely different HP and torque packages for example), to what it takes to make batteries and gather raw materials ethically.

Tesla hasn't been able to do much more than use billions of dollars in tax paid subsidies and investors like Saudi Arabia to build a gigafactory all over the world and then promote China as being better workers than everyone else while continuing to reap the rebates the US offers Tesla drivers. 

It's a sad joke in the end who to purchase from because you're now being forced to make an ethical consumer decision on top of whether you're spending $10k more or not on a car that is the future. 400 + range and batteries not made from child labor harvesting the raw metals to begin with is all I want so I can drive a fully loaded vehicle up Ike's Gauntlet and then some and feel fine as a daisy in the summertime.

Mercedes saying they are delivering on that is a big enough reason for investors and countries to switch over from Teslas Monopoly and Elon Musks actual neo Nazi agenda vs Mercedes old German agenda lol. It's all a joke man.",0

537,16b72u1,Mercedes unveils new electric concept cars with better range than any Tesla model. Puts on TSLA?!,"1st some introduction to German politics, German law does not allow full autonomous driving, so the whole argument goes out the door. Mercedes has the sensors and some of the systems to enable such ideas but it's fair to say it is a long shot to have Mercedes roll out full autonomy tomorrow even if it were allowed.
2nd Mercedes focus the past decade has been on assisted driving, things like lane keeping assist, parking aid, highway cruise control so on and so forth. Through that Mercedes had a large focus on near proximity data and sensors, there is a reason why every drive assistant in modern cars will not go a significantly higher speed than 130 km/h, that's because the faster the vehicle is the further down the road the car has so analyse to make good decisions, the complications grow exponentially with increasing speed and Mercedes had a lot of catching up to do when Tesla first rolled out their version of drive assist because Mercedes focused way havier on the comfort applications of drive assist like parking and lane keeping. 
3rd criticism where criticism is due, Tesla is far away from perfect and some claims made by them are way out of proportion. On the other hand Mercedes has also had their fair share of trouble with driving assist (reminder to Mercedes first iteration of emergency breaking ...) Which led to countless accidents and vehicles called back to the dealership to update the software. Tesla should never have claimed autonomous driving capabilities no question on that front, in contrast it has become quite obvious that Tesla had some sever flaws as well as some oversights on their part eg. not utilizing lidar Sensor. 
All in all it's incorrect of either company to claim autonomous driving capabilities because both have had problems with their programs and as sophisticated as these systems are they can only recognize a situation that has occurred beforehand or they were programmed to deal with. That's also the point where both companies have already experienced turmoil, when their vehicles encounter situations that are not judgable or misinterpreted.",1

Tesla is also rolling out an autopilot system trained on a supercomputer that no auto company would ever be able to build for the next decade.

572,16b72u1,Mercedes unveils new electric concept cars with better range than any Tesla model. Puts on TSLA?!,"Well, there is an argument to be made that Mercedes is no longer really a luxury brand, or other brands are catching on fast to the luxury style of Mercedes therefore taking their competitive edge. In recent years bmw is increasingly moving away from sports/ performance cars towards more and more luxury cars, like limousine style vehicles and their SUV line up. Bmw actually introduced some new color and materials in their line up with a finish that rivals Mercedes. 
On the other hand Tesla's cars especially on the higher end of the budget are also quite renounced nowadays - the model X and model Y are both huge cars rivaling the spaciousness of a GLE and the model S is comparable in dimensions to an amg bi turbo V8 sports coupé, might even be bigger. Now of course everyone always says ""but the build quality???"" And yes Tesla is not spending the same amount of money on the inside of the car as Mercedes is but a Mercedes with comparable stats dimension wise usually already runs you to at least 1.5 times the price and is the slight quality improvement on the inside really worth that amount of money ? And one could add that performance wise the race is not even close, Teslas do not have the best suspension granted but the handling of the cars are second to none, a model Y drives like an amg gt because of its low center of gravity, the electric motors enable an acceleration that is not comparable to combustion engines or any electric car Mercedes has on the road. The model S steps that performance gain up a notch and is really only rivaled by something like the rimac nevera (an electric hyper sports car that costs 20x the price of a model S). Tesla is still in a place where it rivals traditional car manufacturers. And Mercedes is really not as special on luxury in modern times among the ever increasing standards of quality and prestige in the car world, at least not as special as they used to be.",1

On the other hand it's evident that especially with cars there is huge brand value and people totally make decisions based on brand / image in addition to stats. Just talk to somebody that's interested in cars and suggest another comparable brand is better than theirs.

I didn't really base my comment on Reddit communities as much as on irl experience and you're right in that most of my friends are more left-leaning students. I'm aware that this isn't a cross-section of the general public.

However my partner's father is quite wealthy and through him I've talked to a lot of really well-off people, and I can assure you besides one person that owns a software company none of them would ever buy a Tesla, exactly for that reason. It's not that they're left-leaning, it's just that they don't like the image Tesla has and would instead buy a Taycan every day of the week if it has to be electric.

Obviously a Porsche is more expensive and not an option for a lot of Tesla buyers, but that's exactly where I believe Mercedes will come in. If it holds true, it's giving another good option in a price segment that was lacking in competition.",1

>They even admit this today saying they are ""in-between growth waves"". **What does that mean.** When will the next mega growth wave be that justifies the insane market cap? 

It means that Tesla is in the process of building out new production lines that will enable faster growth in 2-3 years.

* Gigafactory Texas (just outside of Austin) is a huge building but still mostly empty.  Tesla has been installing a production line for Cybertruck, and appears to be building production  capacity for its next-generation vehicle (NGV), based on equipment being moved inside.  You can find plenty of drone flyover videos on YouTube.  I recommend Joe Tegtmeyer's channel for regular updates.  
* Gigafactory Berlin has enough newly cleared land area to triple in size
* Tesla is building a lithium refinery at Corpus Christi, Texas, to ensure lithium supply to both its Texas campus and future Mexico campus

&#x200B;

There's a lot going on at Tesla in terms of building infrastructure for the next-generation of vehicles around 2025.  

There's also a lot of work being done on the AI and robotics side of things, particularly with regard to development of custom silicon, AI training, and custom robotics hardware.",28

Tesla has pricing power to drive demand when needed. The only people who seem to deny this are those who are ideologically compromised and cannot make an honest judgement on Tesla as a company because they are clouded by their opinions on Elon. People should be very cautious about making investments, shorts or going long, on any stock they have emotional investment into, you need to hold a cold detached opinion.

Ford announced its nine month EBIT loss in the EV segment to be 3.1 billion ( https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/ford-withdraws-2023-forecast-warns-ev-results-2023-10-26/#:~:text=Ford%20said%20its%20EV%20unit,the%20Ford%20Model%20e%20unit.) this is just one example.

626,17vfy74,"TSLA claims ""We're in-between growth waves"", stock up 6%","Your problem is, macro-economics must be learned along with fundamentals of an individual company.

You can't take TSLA out of all the ETF's/bundles/mutual funds. So buying pressure flows naturally. Esp with pensions buying SP500 companies. It's like trying to stop water coming out from a hose. Sometimes the hose shuts off, but usually the best advice is to not time the market, which means that you should always be buying to get the best cost-basis.

People really believe Musks companies will rescue ourselves from the excesses of capitalism. Investors are simply hedging their bets around climate change, and you can’t totally blame them for trying by using the tools they’ve been taught. But consumption, and the pollution and environmental damage generated from it, is precisely what causes climate change. Yeah, EVs don’t emit as much greenhouse gases when you accelerate, but the are still made of petroleum products and serviced with petroleum lubricants on petroleum roads, shipped across the ocean on massive barges, where everything was manufactured, refined, and mined by carbon-heavy industrial processes. Then after all that waste, the product will just be tossed into a landfill after 10 years.

Down 10% after each of the last several times. Sales and margins are in decline.  But in between those factual milestones-reactions, the stock bubbles up with mood and sentiment and fan control and input from the showman/huckster (depending on your view) founder.  

Numerous analysts and firms point out that if Tesla were to be deemed an automaker, automaker multiples would value it $50-90 per share.  

Steve Eisner, short on Tesla over 5-6 years, is currently short again and says he will remain so until $100 or less, and that it's headed to $50.  

Jim Cramer openly says he ignores the fundamentals, pinches his nose, and has faith in the ""pitchman"" to drive the price higher.  

Even analyst banks who are bullish on it have breakdowns in which they acknowledge that more than half of current valuation is derived from side businesses that won't even have any revenue until 2028 or later.  

I find it too tricky to play.  As much as I want to avoid going near anything their fraudulent founder touches, I believe that other people hired there are doing the actual work, doing the actual engineering, running the actual business, and those people likely make up for his deficiencies.  I do wonder if he ever found the right treatment to stop acting how he is, and if they hired a cool designer, and then launched some truly marketable new generations of their vehicles, they could take some market share as an automaker.

685,17vfy74,"TSLA claims ""We're in-between growth waves"", stock up 6%","Original long term guidance was for 50% CAGR indexed from 2020, going through 2030.

So that’s:
2020: 500,000
2021: 750,000
2022: 1,125,000
2023: 1,687,500
2024: 2,531,250
2025: 3,796,875

So 2020/2021 was the middle of Model 3/Y major ramp period. In 2023, guidance was for 1.8 million, which is well ahead of the 1.69 million necessary to keep with the long term. 50% CAGR target. They appear to be on course to get pretty close to the 1.8 million mark for 2023.

However, bringing production online is always stair steps. And 2024 may not meet the 2.5 million mark to keep the long term target, as the next gen vehicle plant won’t be online quick enough to make a significant contribution for that. Originally, they were going to build their next gen vehicle in Mexico, but they decided to expand their Austin factory instead and Mexico would come later.

As it stands, they have roughly 650,000 capacity in Fremont, 1.1 million in Shanghai, 250,000 in Berlin, and 175,000 in Austin. So their current capacity is near 2.2 million. They are expanding both Berlin and Austin, so they have a shot at being able to produce 2.5 million in 2024. The factory footprint is there for expanding Austin to 500,000 (Model Y + Cybertruck) but it is unlikely they will be able to scale up to all of that for 2024, but may hit that as a run rate at the end of 2024.

So YoY, they are probably looking at 30-35% growth with a shot at higher, with next gen coming online at end of 2024 or in 2025. For their long term target, they may come in about 10-15% shy of their long term 2024 target. For 2025/2026, they should have the next big step up in production capacity to hit or exceed their long term CAGR guidance.",1

Looking at traditional car sites, like Car & Driver, Teslas are already ranked in the mid to back of the pack of their categories.  Traditional car drivers seem unlikely to shift in masse to Teslas, which drive significantly different than an ICE car; they are favoring the legacy carmakers that give a more traditional driving experience with their EVs.

Tesla seems to be settling in as a niche carmaker.  They will have a relatively small share of drivers, but those will be loyal customers.

764,17vfy74,"TSLA claims ""We're in-between growth waves"", stock up 6%","A lot of what you wrote shows how misinformed you are about the auto market and the EV transition. Just off the top of my head:

* ICE profits won't last. Eventually 100% of the cars sold will be EV's, no one, not even the traditional automakers are pretending otherwise on this.

* The problem for the traditional automakers is that the EV transition isn't going to go in a straight line, it's been going in an exponential S-curve. While EV adoption had a slower start in the US by comparison, you can look ahead at other regions like Europe and China to see how it's going to turn out in the US sooner or later. 

* Point being, consumer sentiment WILL shift in favor of EV's in much larger numbers sooner or later, and if traditional automakers aren't ready then they're going to feel a lot of pain as their ICE sales tank, especially if they can't produce and sell enough EV's to counter-act those ICE losses.

* The other problem with the above points is that it takes 3 years on average for a car to go from the idea/design phase to being brought to the market and put in the hands of consumers. So it's quite possible that traditional automakers will run out of time to make the transition and be screwed. This is already happening to a number of automakers in China where they aren't going to be allowed to sell some types of ICE vehicles very soon.

Bottom line, I don't see anyway around it, some automakers are going to go bankrupt because they fail to make the transition to EV's, or at the very least will need bailed out by the government. The fact that so many automakers are pushing the break on their shift to the EV transition lately is really going to screw them over in the next few years.",9

766,17vfy74,"TSLA claims ""We're in-between growth waves"", stock up 6%",">What exactly are the market advantages tesla has over other car companies? 

&#x200B;

(1) Software.  Compare Tesla's user interface to that of a Hyundai Ionic 5 or Volkswagen ID.4.  Tesla's interface is smoother and easier to use.  Tesla's control of their entire hardware platform and software stack, means they can more easily update their software.  Ford CEO Jim Farley explains the basic problem for other car companies:  [the software is all written by 150 different companies and they don’t talk to each other,  Even if I had a high-speed modem in the vehicle and I had the ability to write their software, it's actually their IP.](https://www.thedrive.com/news/ford-ceo-explains-why-legacy-automakers-take-forever-to-issue-ota-updates)

Ford is trying to bring this stuff back in-house, but it remains to be seen if they can recruit the talent necessary to do all the hardware and software themselves.  Volkswagen has thus far done a mediocre job of this (which in part [cost former VW CEO Herber Diess his own job](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/volkswagens-ceo-diess-leave-company-2022-07-22/))

&#x200B;

(2) Hardware.  Tesla has had entire teams devoted to developing custom silicon for its autonomous driving and AI projects.  Chips like HW3, HW4, and Dojo D1 give Tesla a big edge, as they can get the performance and efficiency specs they want, on the algorithms they plan to run.  

&#x200B;

(3) Economies of scale.  Tesla builds an order of magnitude more EVs for the U.S. market than its competitors: [https://www.evautoblog.com/news/tesla-model-3-and-y-still-dominating-u-s-ev-market-shows-data/](https://www.evautoblog.com/news/tesla-model-3-and-y-still-dominating-u-s-ev-market-shows-data/).  For example, they make about 10x more EVs than Ford.  With economies of scale, come cost benefits.  Competitors, except Chinese, are hurting:

* [Ford hits the brakes on $12 billion in EV spending because EVs are too expensive](https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/26/23934172/ford-12-billion-ev-investment-postpone-q3-earnings)
* [Honda CEO says firm is ending partnership with GM to develop affordable EVs](https://fortune.com/2023/10/25/honda-ceo-ending-partnership-gm-develop-affordable-evs-uaw-strike-automaker/)
* [Volkswagen to temporarily cut production of two EV models due to weaker demand](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/volkswagen-temporarily-pause-production-two-ev-car-models-due-drop-demand-2023-09-26/)

Note that Tesla continues to expand its economies of scale in the long run, by building its own lithium refining operations at Corpus Christi, TX, and continuing to scale up its in-house battery cell manufacturing capacity.  

&#x200B;

(4) Products beyond automotive

* Tesla sells stationary storage battery products (about a 6 Billion/year business from latest SEC filings), which is growing very rapidly and turns a profit at higher margins than cars.
* Future product pipeline includes AI training as a service (Dojo), and robots (Optimus android).  This is where Tesla's ability to attract top computer engineering and software engineering talent gives them a big edge.",15

Model 3 was/is a game changer, but a lot of people were already so convinced emotionally that Musk was an empty suit and EVs were a joke that they couldn't see what was coming. Huge innovations in manufacturing efficiency and a product superior in many ways to the ICE it replaced. Many bulls got so emotionally convinced that Musk was a genius that they excused multiple mistakes in 2022 and 2023, thinking Musk knew better than all the analysts on things like the unique and hard-to-make design of Cybertruck, and postponing new vehicle models in the belief FSD was coming any day and would make the need for more models obsolete.

That's nonsense.  ICE cars will be apart of the market for the foreseeable future, several decades at least.  There are significant parts of the market where EVs simply are not practical with current or foreseeable technology; it is just fantasy to think otherwise.

None of they legacy automakers have any plans to shut down there ICE production; you are simply making that up.

>The problem for the traditional automakers is that the EV transition isn't going to go in a straight line, it's been going in an exponential S-curve

No, that's just an absurd claim.  EV early adopters are already in the market.  The mass market is skeptical about EVs; many don't have easy access to charging, drive to much, or in isolated areas, to make charging practical.

Consumer demand is simply not there for a huge market shift in the near term.  Automakers are slowing their EV rollouts specifically for this reason.

>Point being, consumer sentiment WILL shift in favor of EV's in much larger numbers sooner or later, and if traditional automakers aren't ready then they're going to feel a lot of pain as their ICE sales tank, especially if they can't produce and sell enough EV's to counter-act those ICE losses.

ICE SUVs and trucks are where the consumer demand is.  It i going to be a long haul for EVs to chip away at that market share.  Consumers are already pushing back on increasing the EV mix, and forcing automakers to delay rollouts because of a lack of demand.  Your claim doesn't jibe with the reality in the market.

>The other problem with the above points is that it takes 3 years on average for a car to go from the idea/design phase to being brought to the market and put in the hands of consumers. So it's quite possible that traditional automakers will run out of time to make the transition and be screwed.

Again, it is absurd to think that mass market EV transition is going to be in the next 3 years; it will take several decades, and ICE vehicles are likely to still have a significant part of the market after that.

>China where they aren't going to be allowed to sell some types of ICE vehicles very soon

Government mandate like that won't fly in most of the US.  If the government feels the need to force consumers into a new technology, that is an indicator that the technology isn't ready for the mass market.  You are undermining your own argument here.

>I don't see anyway around it, some automakers are going to go bankrupt because they fail to make the transition to EV's

You need to look at the realities of the market.  ICE demand is strong, and the mass market is wary of EV tech.  You are just completely misreading the situation; just like most new tech, early adopters have jumped in, but it is going to be a long slog to get most of the market to transition.  We are talking decades here; not years.

>The fact that so many automakers are pushing the break on their shift to the EV transition

They are doing this because customers don't want to switch to EVs.  You are ignoring how the market is actually reacting in preference to your unsupported narrative.",0

Not true.

They started 10 years too late and the market is already largely taken, they can't sell EVs for ridiculous prices because people won't get them since there's options.

> So you are pointing out that there are so many competitors that the market is splitting up between them. You are supporting my argument that Tesla is a niche player.

Last year Tesla's market share was 71%, very niche indeed, this year now that there's more competition (particularly in the high end market, which isn't as largely affected by the current economic context) you can actually buy from it's just 57%, then again they're also selling more than last year, the market just grew. By the way, depending on what model you want to get from them there might be waiting time, they literally can't keep up with demand. Meanwhile their competitors have their EVs sitting in a parking lot lol.

> That is just not true.

Their competitors are either inferior, don't really compete with them (selling a $300k EV Porsche that loses Porsche a fortune isn't exactly competition, they aim for a different kind of people) or are going at a massive loss that they won't be able to afford. Again, they won't be able to sell their just-came-out-from-R&D cars for $100k, they'll have to sell them for 1/5 of that, and that'll cost them too much.

> You ignored my point that actual reviews are out there; the Car & Driver ratings show that Teslas are near the back of the pack in every category of EV. You are ignoring what the market is saying; the facts prove you wrong.

Reviews are not trustworthy, especially when Tesla has pretty much all of the media against it. What matters is market share and market valuation, which strongly supports my argument. Tesla is worth more than every other trying-to-get-into-the-EV-market company combined, they sell almost twice as much as all of them combined, while having big future prospects in other areas.",2

Companies that don't build their own infotainment systems then pay licensing money to Apple and Google, and have no control over the overall experience of the system.  

Your take on the car electronic control systems is incorrect.  It is much slower to create and update software when the electronic control systems are made by dozens or even over 100 suppliers.  Did you read what the Ford CEO said?  Trying to integrate 150 pieces of software from systems created by other companies is difficult and time consuming.  

The number of car models released has nothing to do with Tesla's electronic controls architecture.  They all use a common computing system.  Their product lineup is the result of deliberate choices not to complicate manufacturing.

863,17j4q1u,We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),"Overall I think Tesla will come out just fine/ too early to be worried about Tesla.   Tesla is taking steps to prepare for lessening in demand due to inflation and interest rate increases.

They have basically no debt compare to the amount of cash they are holding. They are cash flow positive and they are continuing to build up the amount they are holding.

They are able to cut pricing aggressively to generate demand while still making money on each sale while their competitors are losing money on every EV.

On Cybertruck - it’s normal for any new product to take a while to make back the initial investment in new production lines, it was the case for all the previous models Tesla produced. It will likely be priced higher than the initial introduction due to inflation and with higher interest rate there will be an impact on demand. Given they are starting with the more expensive trim, it hard to tell how much of an impact there will be since people with higher income will be less affected by interest rate.

FSD - personally I use it on my drives and it’s worth it for the initial price I got it at 5k, 5 years ago. It’s been amazing to see the progress it has made. 
For people who drive a lot, I think it’s worth getting the subscription at the current state. I view FSD / AI as nice bonus, Tesla is not going to die in if they don’t figure it out in the near future.

864,17j4q1u,We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),"I'll try to play devil's advocate and present you the thought process from a fund perspective. Whenever you're considering a play, the best thing to do is to first evaluate it in the context of its industry. You've gone very granular into the risks of Tesla, but haven't really presented it in the context versus competitors (i.e comparing TSLA's book metrics vs competitors, product cost/benefit vs competitors, etc). In other words, the first thing to ask yourself is are you actually truly bearish just Tesla or just bearish the entire auto/EV industry?

&nbsp;

From a buyside institutional perspective, the reason why that question above is so important is because when presenting a trade thesis, you have to consider not just idea generation, but also **idea execution.** 

&nbsp;

So this brings me to the next point: what if in the extreme case, I told you institutions were short every auto/EV (i.e industry short) and long TSLA over the five year span I mentioned? You mention that ""the 857% total return of Tesla is substantially higher than all of its peers, including Ford, Toyota, and Volkswagen."" What if I told you institutions holding TSLA are ""only"" up 100% total return in that span? Sure, there are going to be institutions that will only hold a long TSLA as representative bet on the industry, but by in large those will be the minority of funds.

Tesla is a fantastic business that has a sizable lead in a growing market.  The reality is that Tesla is going to look more like Mercedes Benz than what it looks like today.

Plus, Tesla is working to control the battery ecosystem. From making to their own batteries, to recycling, to all the way to controlling material supplies for refined lithium and related battery components. They’re just way ahead of the competition.

I think this is important: if you drive a tesla or buy a tesla musk is going to come up in conversation and while there is plenty of apolitical people there are just as many political people who want nothing to do with the man or his products. Its constant negative press. Equally the political base he now appealing to, the right, aren't going to be buying EV vechs or cybertrucks.

If you're worried about Tesla in this recession you're not doing enough homework about the other automotive manufacturers out there they're the ones who are in real trouble.",1
958,17j4q1u,We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),"Tesla is an energy company that makes cars (and trucks) and soon class 8 trucks.  They have one of, if not, the world's largest neuralnetworks and a leader, if not in the lead, on supercomputing & AI.  Oh yea and PowerWall. Oh yea and soon Robots.  Oh yea and ...

Tesla will be just fine. It may take a while, could be measured in years possibly, but their market value today is nowhere near what it will be in the future. 

Anyone that is caught up and worrying about how many cars they are selling is missing the big picture, by a huge margin.",1
959,17j4q1u,We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),Just imagine when people start realizing that Elon is a lying African.,1
960,17j4q1u,We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),Not only off of cars charging but also others buying superchargers (e.g. the 100m deal just inked with BP). There's no supplier of charger hardware that has a higher reliability. People are really starting to hate networks that aren't reliable.,139
961,17j4q1u,We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),I heard on the earnings call that charges make very little money actually.,35
962,17j4q1u,We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),"They can certainly make some money but since this is a retail business (buy and sell electricity) this isn't going be some crazy profit margins. Gas stations don't make bank on the gas they sell, their profit is in all the snacks and stuff they sell at the cashier.",7
963,17j4q1u,We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),There are a lot of revenue opportunities for Tesla. I worry that Elon overpromises and underdelivers. I point out some sketchy guidance the company is making. What I wrote is just the tip of the iceberg.,42
964,17j4q1u,We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),"I'm also curious how many potential customers will they lose for opening up Tesla supercharger.

Some people never consider non-Teslas because they're worried about charging on road trips. Now that won't be a problem anymore.

Even if they charge at home 99% of the time, and supercharger is just a ""peace of mind"".",9
965,17j4q1u,We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),"I'm a tesla bull but IMO very little in proportion to other areas of the business. Cars will mostly charge at home or work. Tesla arent charging non tesla customers more, and they're not and won't price gauge. There will prob be some revenue around data selling (supercharger network status in route planning). Selling the actual 'parts' might be reasonable revenue driver following BP deal, but I think the sum total will be mininal in comparison to the car manufacturing business, FSD/AI/robotaxi, energy storage, insurance and other possible businesses (Optimus, HVAC, solar comeback).",2
966,17j4q1u,We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),"Charging sadly has very little earning potential. Single charger simply can't create much revenue, or the price of the service becomes offputting.",2
967,17j4q1u,We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),"a fair question, but imo the market is still too small and need to supercharge far too uncommon for this to be a cash cow, since they can't jack up the prices too high without alienating their own customer base, current and future",2
968,17j4q1u,We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),They just sold like $100MM worth of their superchargers to BP (?) or an equivalent,4
969,17j4q1u,We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),"and licensing out their technology.

Tesla is an EV solutions company that created their own demand and made their competition buy into their solutions.

The supercharger network is nothing short of amazing. Compare it to Electrify America and it's night and day.


Cybertruck is going to be a damper on profits for a bit, but I suspect the only reason it's going to be a dark horse for a bit is because it's coming out just as interest rates and auto loans jump up.

I dont think TSLA is in trouble at all right now. This isnt the first elon announcement and this isnt the first time a new product line has popped up creating doubt.

The model 3 almost killed the company, and then made it insanely profitable, then the Model Y dropped and practically printed money.

Pre 2018 TSLA was tumultuous, and heavily shorted. Which is why most investment you see now is post 2018 when everyone else jumped in. If it dips down I'm buying more.",1
970,17j4q1u,We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),"This. I dont value tesla like the dreamers do with these ridiculous stock prices, but, if tesla makes the right moves, they could become an energy company first, car company second. Then the valuation will make a bit more sense. 

They can still trip on their dicks and mess this up though.",1
971,17j4q1u,We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),There is an analyst who did the math on this on cnbc.,1
972,17j4q1u,We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),if elon was actually smart he woulda stuck to building infrastructure,1
973,17j4q1u,We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),"The problem is that the biggest part of their potential future valuation is for parts of the business that barely exists right now: *actual* full self-driving and the business opportunities that opens up both as personal taxis, shared personally-owned taxis, and for companies like Uber and Lyft.  Tesla could either sell a lot more cars or license that self-driving tech to not only their own car buyers, but to other companies.

Some investors give them HUGE valuation because they think Tesla is way ahead on FSD due to the amount of data they collect.  Of course, that assumes other things are equal, which is rarely the case especially with things as complex as this.  IMO Tesla will not gain much if any actual advantage with FSD long-term, and so they essentially are primarily a car company and as such are vastly overvalued.",48
974,17j4q1u,We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),"It's not so rare to see companies dabble in many different industries.

Man people see Samsung as phones, tablets, fridges and other electronics.

But they're also the 7th largest ship builder.

South Korea largest insurance company

Worlds 10th largest marketing company (cheil)

South Korea largest resort and entertainment park (Everland)

They also own a different insurance company.

They also run a chain of hotels + some hospitals.

They also have some kind of bank / financial services.


And more.",23
975,17j4q1u,We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),"I honestly think this is overcomplicating it. At its heart, Tesla is a car manufacturer that dips into the energy sector. It mostly competes with other car manufacturers. Its peers are other car manufacturers. The only aspects of Tesla's business that seem to have no direct competition from other car manufacturers are the Powerwall and the Supercharger network.

I have personally never understood Tesla's valuation (many times the value of the rest of the auto sector put together). I expect a lot of retail investors will be left holding the bag as other car manufacturers continue to gobble up the startup tech they should've invested in 10 years ago, which will likely put them on better footing compared to Tesla in the long term.",16
976,17j4q1u,We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),Very reasonable take imo,6
977,17j4q1u,We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),"It is just a car company.  Tesla makes money by selling cars, not by selling software, charging networks, powerwall or anything else. It is dramatically overvalued because so many investors have bought into the hype about the tech, green energy, and Musk's brilliance, etc, etc.  It is a car company.  They sell cars.  Period.",10
978,17j4q1u,We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),"It's a car company. Hyundai has better robotics than Tesla, and other car companies are starting to beat them in self driving. They don't even make the batteries, Panasonic does. Elon tries to sell it as a tech company, be he's been proven full of shit too many times to be trusted.

That said I should not be worried about Tesla, because I don't own any.",2

981,17j4q1u,We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),Interestingly enough I don't see it tanking until Elon takes one of his other companies public. I think a lot of people sort of basket his other companies with this stock in a hype,1
982,17j4q1u,We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),[deleted],38
983,17j4q1u,We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),I tend to agree and think Tesla is just trying to get as many people as possible to have one. I wonder what the revenue stream would look like if they started selling apps on their infotainment in addition to Supercharging and FSD software upgrades,12
984,17j4q1u,We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),Would a 16yo tesla even turn on? I genuinely have no idea how long they last.,3
985,17j4q1u,We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),What region do you live in? Tesla's are much more popular around cities. Financials show that vehicle delivery growth is slowing quite dramatically.,0

987,17j4q1u,We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),"This is why I won't be selling my remaining shares for the foreseeable future. Right now a lot of the people buying Teslas are people with disposable income who want to be the first with a new trophy. Steadily it's transitioning to people who now see it as a financial win, and that trend will continue. Tesla will keep making hype cars for the trophy crowd and more and more sales will go to average joe. This is the same exact story as was with model 3 production ramp.

It's also easy to hold my remaining shares since I already quadrupled my entire portfolio with my tesla shares from 2014-2018.",1

994,17j4q1u,We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),"You do realize no one is suggesting Tesla is a bad company or in danger of defaulting? They are quite a good company. The question is valuation seems to be far higher than their intrinsic value can support.

It is weird how people can not understand that a good or great company can still be overvalued. That is two differant things.",5
995,17j4q1u,We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),"You're not answering the question at all. Is tesla at 68 p/e ratio overvalued for a growth stock that is not growing as hoped based on most recent earnings? that is the question. ""Overall I think tesla will come out just fine"" is completely ignoring the point or maybe you do not know how to calculate/estimate the value of a company",6
996,17j4q1u,We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),"I am not worried about Tesla (the company), as you rightfully point out it's not in any danger.

I am worried about the shareholders who might have bought at insane valuation and might end up bagholding once the market reprice the stock as just another healthy car maker (and these barely go above a PE of 10)",3
997,17j4q1u,We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),"Classic case of overanalysing the irrelevant. How have funds trading Tesla based on fundamentals fared over the years?

TSLA is much more a function of liquidity and sentiment.",2
998,17j4q1u,We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),">the 857% total return of Tesla is substantially higher than all of its peers, including Ford, Toyota, and Volkswagen.

You bring up some very valid points. I guess I believe that EVs will be beaten by hybrids in the market. I also bring up Tesla because the Enterprise value is so much higher than its competitors (it has the most to lose). If all enterprise values were similar in regards to projected earnings in the near term, I would not really be worried.",0

1001,17j4q1u,We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),"Parts of my posts are opinion, but the part you cited is not. Musk did not mention that the deposit was $100 on the calls. Elon Musk set the deposit so ridiculously low, so he could parade that demand for the Cybertruck was ""off the hook"". This was an intentional action to mislead shareholders and wall street. Why not set the preorder at $1,000? anyone serious about buying a truck would gladly put up that deposit and wait a year. In fact, Tesla made the reservation for the Roadster $5,000 AND there is no concrete timeframe on that vehicle.

You are correct that Tesla is not the only one suffering. However, based on the financials this year, Tesla is DISPROPORTIONATELY impacted.",-14
1002,17j4q1u,We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),Tesla is definitely doing a lot right. I just think that executive team misleads shareholders egregiously to drive share price up.,46
1003,17j4q1u,We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),"Tesla imo is two companies.   A car company and everything else.  The car company is worth about 350b, everything else is the moonshot idea that could catapult them.  

Think of it like apple.   Apple didn't blow up until iPhone.  What will teslas new product be?  They have lots of ideas but for me, I really need to see one of those segments really take off.  Then I think a 1T valuation could be in order",4

You seem to be ignoring that Tesla is moving downmarket. The compact will open huge new market segments. As will the Cybertruck.",1

I have absolutely no view on Tesla or the EV market, but why not also first compare metrics that aren't affected by public sentiment (like market cap or enterprise value are). At the simplest level compared to its competitors (thus far, and not speaking about the future), Tesla's profit margins far, far outperform on a per vehicle basis as well as on a holistic company basis. How about its free cash flow? R&D spend vs competitors? Top and bottom line projected growth vs. competitors?

So the two ""company specific"" aspects to Tesla you've presented as negative catalysts, FSD and Cybertruck, are interesting. FSD is truly company specific to Tesla, but Cybertruck is not really. What I mean by this is that auto/EV makers (which is Tesla's main industry) all have the same risks from this categorical new product launch (i.e GM with EV Hummer for instance, Rivian etc).

It also isn't necessarily the case that Hyundai *can't* make a quality car just because their focus has historically been on cheaper quality but more affordable cars. And with EVs being intrinsically expensive up to now, Hyundai and Kia have focused on quality with their EVs over affordability.

Additionally, higher quality than Tesla is a really low bar. When I bought my Kia EV (2020) Teslas had terrible soundproofing (in a $45k vehicle) and heat pumps that kept the cabin warm were failing. At some point Tesla removed radar from their vehicles to save money, while no other manufacturer did the same (they may have since added it back, not sure).

EVs are net-negative energy-wise at the national and global level.  There are energy losses involved with charging and sitting idle that are just wasting energy that could otherwise be used elsewhere.  The only reason these cars are cheaper to operate is they are subsidized thru tax credits and lower excise taxes.  That will eventually go away and operating costs will skyrocket.

EVs are also propped up by the climate change fictions.  At some point that will be unsustainable too.  The warning sign there will be a shift in R&D and academia toward some other large technology cash cow massive project they can use as a revenue stream for their industry.  Nuclear gen IV and asteroid defense are too specialized.

> Oh I didn’t realize you were one of them. Did you read the deposit was $100. You are brain dead if you think that even 20% of those will convert to sales. It’s actually something called common sense. If you were actually well read about finance or business in general, you would know that low commitment refundable deposits do not convert on high ticket vehicles.

This is the most illogical argument you can think of. Even if 0% of those reservations convert, they can still sell millions of Cybertrucks. 99.9% of cars sold are just people buying a car long after it first hit the market. So even if 20% of those reservations convert (I personally think it'll be somewhere between 20% and 50%), that's 3+ years of production sold out, while 99.9% of sales will start after those reservations are delivered.

> Also, for level 3 I’m citing Tesla’s letter to California that states they have no intent to go beyond level 2 for the foreseeable future.

You misread that letter. Tesla has no intend of going above Level 2 until they solve full autonomy, as it's an unnecessary distraction. Nowhere is it written that you need a level 3 or 4 system to be able to build a fully autonomous car. It's just arbitrary benchmarks.

Unclear.  If dealing with the remaining edge cases were as simple as just solving them, then I would say Tesla is very near.  But AI does not work like that.  They have to solve the edge cases without screwing up the stuff that already works well.  And that is where we get into ultra-cutting-edge technology that nobody can predict well.  

The fact that Tesla has moved from heuristics to a fully end-to-end system should improve progress.  But unless you work for Tesla's AI team, I doubt you can shine much light on this.  

Ultimately it comes down to how much you believe in Tesla's AI team.

This is untrue.

I've been a TSLA shareholder since 2011, and was a participating member at Tesla Motors Club investor forums for much of the 2010s.  

Many of Tesla's largest, long-term retail investors (some with 400,000 to 500,000 or more TSLA shares) have significant professional expertise in engineering, computer science, and business.  It was that expertise that led many to conclude that the conventional wisdom about Tesla was incorrect.  

The unsophisticated investors who maybe buy a few shares on their Robinhood accounts, don't have the financial firepower to prop up a 700 Billion market cap.  

Looking at TSLA trading volume alone, an average of about 115 million shares traded daily over the past month, according to Yahoo Finance, that amounts to 10s of Billions of $ worth of shares trading hands every day.   This is not something that small retail can have much effect on.",4

This is important for valuation models that drive the price of the stock price due to TVM. My argument is perfectly logical when valuing the company... I would assume you are not a finance person, so your ignorance is tolerable.

""You do not need a level 3 or 4 system to build an autonomous car""

This is a self-contradicting statement. An autonomous car is a level 3+ system. Why is Tesla not testing any of these systems? Maybe because they are not close... Meanwhile Waymo and Mobileye have Level 4 systems with no one in the driver seat. You are essentially saying that Tesla should not focus on real autonomous driving and instead focus on gimmicks.

For anyone new out there like you, rides without critical disengagements need to be substantially higher than 94% to be safe. Tesla's safety is worse than drunk drivers. So they fail the first test. The second test is rides without disengagements which measures the actual effectiveness of a system. Tesla is around 30-40% which is abysmal.

The big problem that I have with Tesla is that they break ethics, rules and regulations at every turn. They basically gave a level 2 system over to the public and marketed it as a level 4 system. They have less safeties in place so the car is more likely to just keep going and blame the driver for not taking over and avoiding the accident when something inevitably goes wrong.

I've been continuously weighing different factors of Tesla's business since 2011.  That means knowing the members of the leadership team, knowing the products and product pipeline, knowing the various industries Tesla operates in, reading the SEC filings, and much more.

They were on the verge of bankruptcy for almost all of the 2010s.

Most or even all of this is/was publicly available in the 10-Q and 10-K filings.  

I also was able to make an educated guess at what level of production, sales, and margin Tesla would need to escape that black hole of debt.

> Tesla ending up as it is today is luck. 

**Nothing is all luck or all skill.**

Yes, there was some element of luck to TSLA.

If a random big earthquake had destroyed Tesla's Fremont factory at some point in the mid-2010s, Tesla probably would've gone bankrupt.  That would have been bad luck.  And it wouldn't have been unprecedented either -- the 2011 Tsunami, caused by an earthquake, severely disrupted Japanese automotive production.

If Russia had assassinated Elon Musk in the 2010s in an attempt to slow SpaceX, that would probably have led to Tesla going bankrupt during 2017-2018 ""production hell"".  That would have been bad luck too.

Tesla was setting up the initial production line for Model S in 2011.  The company had bought [what is now the Tesla Factory at Fremont](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Fremont_Factory) from Toyota in 2010, after Toyota and GM shut down the NUMMI joint venture they'd previously operated there.  

The broader picture you miss is that Tesla in 2011 had a lot of talent.  The efforts of talented people are more important in a startup than the factory.  It's the talent that brings the organization to life.

Straubel, Model S program director Jerome Guillen (hired from Daimler), manufacturing operations executive Gilbert Passin (hired from Toyota), VP of business development Diarmuid O'Connell, VP of worldwide retail George Blankenship (former Apple exec who had developed Apple stores), and probably several others I'm forgetting at the moment.  CEO Elon Musk, as controversial as he is today, had put together a star management team.  These people were worth investing in.

&#x200B;

> If anything, your decision to hold a company that nearly went bankrupt multiple times shows how incompetent you were. 

No, this is called taking a calculated risk.  

My purchases of TSLA stock over the past 12 years represent only a small % of the total money I used to buy investments.  

I've ploughed the vast majority of my savings since 1997 into boring index funds and ETFs like SPY.  

If TSLA had gone bankrupt in 2013 or 2019, my daily finances and long-term retirement plans would have been unaffected.",2

Now the CT may not (ok, no F-ING WAY) be the big thing Musk thought it would be but still, they got years to keep being ahead.

If you spent that money to buy calls that expired out to March or April 2024 you wouldn’t be losing all your money.

1729,18d6f71,Only took me 9 days to lose 290k yoloing on TSLA calls,"Not to be “that guy” but I’m pretty sure I figured out the issue with your strategy. 

If I tell you this secret, you have to promise not to share it though. It’s life changing advice and I think you’ll agree. 

If you’re trying to *make* money (not give it away) you should try selling when the numbers are higher than the amount you paid. This is called “profit.” 

Try it again but with this new knowledge in mind. Let us know when you’re ready to post your gains based on this knowledge. 

P.S. Please don’t tell everyone about this or report me to the S.E.C.

Walmart entered the German market in 1997 with the acquisition of the Wertkauf and Interspar hypermarket chains. However, Walmart’s German stores struggled because its business model wasn’t working there. Walmart wanted to follow the below-cost strategy, but the German business owners didn’t like Walmart’s low-cost pricing tactic as well as the German government. As a result, the American giant was ordered to raise its prices by the German high court which became an obstacle for it to having a customer base. Walmart and German unions were incompatible. In Germany, unlike in the US, unions are very much a part of the culture and have broad support amongst the government, the community, and even businesses. Walmart didn’t understand that in Germany, companies and unions are closely connected. Also, The German workforce is accustomed to negotiating their pay with their union. This caused friction between the workers and the company. When Walmart refused to join Germany’s regional wage bargaining system, the worker’s union went on strike.

“First, government incentives have made EVs the best financial choice for consumers. Norwegians who buy all-electric vehicles do not have to pay high value-added taxes or registration taxes and receive other financial benefits as well.”


“Second, the government has invested heavily in EV chargers and as a result Norway has the most public fast chargers per capita of any country in the world. These can get an EV battery from zero to 80% in as little as 20 minutes. In addition, Norway has established a right to charge for people living in apartment buildings and provides grants for housing associations to install their own chargers.

Third, Norway has also provided EV owners with some attractive perks, such as free parking in cities, exemptions or reductions in road tolls, access to priority bus lanes and reduced rates for EVs to be transported by ferry (ferries are frequently used given Norway’s fjord-covered landscape).

2249,18ch3n7,Danish pension funds (43 billion USD) starts selling TSLA stocks due to labor union dispute,"You do not understand how collective agreements work - this is like saying that supporting the [minimum wage of 10.42£ in the UK](https://www.acas.org.uk/national-minimum-wage-entitlement) means that you want every person in the UK to earn 10.42£.

In Sweden we have no minimum wage - 90% of our companies are part of these collective agreements with the union.[It's not only about salaries - it's about insurance, pensions, salary increases and fairness.](https://www.beyondo.se/news/collective-agreements-in-sweden)

Technology & Options do not solve worker rights. They are not ""getting pension funds and governments involved"" - our government is very much NOT allowed to get involved even if they have tried to get the unions to stop. Our unions are very sympathetic and work together. This is why the postal workers, harbour workers and unions in Norway and Denmark have started to ""sympathize strike"" against Tesla.

IF is not losing - they are just following procedure with the rest of the unions when ""rock star CEOs"" try to ignore our ruleset. [According to the numbers they have 10 billion SEK in their battle chest which is enough to keep the strike going for 500 years.](https://omni.se/if-metall-star-redo-med-10-miljarder-i-strejkkassan/a/veBVxL)

Companies have tried this before - [Toys R US had to give up and form a special case for Sweden with their ""no union policy""](https://www.huffpost.com/archive/ca/entry/what-canada-can-learn-from-swedens-unionized-retail-workers_n_6888328) and[Amazon had to change to a third-hand-party with collective agreement because you can't fight the unions here](https://www.politico.eu/article/amazons-cut-price-culture-meets-swedens-unions/). The reason the unions are fighting hard is because that's why they exist. To force companies to fall in line to Swedish worker demands.

[Sweden is among the most unionized countries in the world](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1356735/labor-unions-most-unionized-countries-worldwide/) with 65.7% of the workforce unionized. You can't just ignore that if you want to last here.  


Edit:    
\> *IF is fighting hard and it’s definitely not going their way, otherwise  they wouldn’t have to get pension funds and governments involved.*   


This is the dumbest argument. It's like saying *""the US is fighting Japan hard and it's definitely not going their way, otherwise they wouldn't have to get nuclear bombs or ships involved.""*

Stuff like the pension funds and getting other countries Unions involved are powerful weapons that make the fight go IF's way.",11
2250,18ch3n7,Danish pension funds (43 billion USD) starts selling TSLA stocks due to labor union dispute,"I mean that's just how entry level salaries work. And from my understanding new car mechanics with no experience on their first job all make more than 23 000 due to the high demand for them so it's not surprising in the least that Tesla has higher entry level salaries than what the CBA requires. Everyone else does too. The 23 000 SEK is a floor for newbies the times when there isn't a high demand.

I mean do you \_really\_ believe that all the other mechanics at BMW, Volvo, Ford etc only make 23 000? Of course you don't, that would be stupid.

And if it was only about salaries there probably wouldn't be a strike. The CBA is about pensions, insurances, overtime payments and yearly raises to name a few areas where Tesla has fallen short according to employees on strike,",1

If you followed the story of reusable rockets, you'd understand that Shuttle and Falcon 9 are radically different designs. Comparing them the way you have done here - extrapolating the failures of Shuttle to Falcon 9 - can only be described as disingenuous.

You have spun a narrative here, that is fair to say. I'm sure some of those unfamiliar with the subject will find it quite convincing.",6
2253,18ch3n7,Danish pension funds (43 billion USD) starts selling TSLA stocks due to labor union dispute,Great analysis. Thank you for explaining this!,0
2254,18ch3n7,Danish pension funds (43 billion USD) starts selling TSLA stocks due to labor union dispute,"What are you smoking the Falcon 9 is the cheapest per kg launch by a long shot with the soyuz-2 coming in second with like 30% the efficiency. Ignoring the fact that the USA would like to pay a premium to not be tied to a Russian system. Sure not every launch needs that capacity, but even if it's only at 1/4 load it's still competitive, and probably still the most reliable.  


Your numbers are also a bit wonky. So fuel in rockets is the cheap part of them compared to everything else, and weight of payload is far more the limiting factor for fuel usage than reuse. So yeah reusing the rocket cuts the amount of payload it can carry, however the falcon 9 can carry way more than all but the ULAs Atlas V, in it's weight group. And the Atlas V costs over 40million more to launch currently. The ones even bigger than that cost astronomical amounts and are rarely used. Which the Falcon 9 heavy crushes in both max weight liftable and expected cost.",1
