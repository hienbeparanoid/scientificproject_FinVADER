17leoks,Thoughts on $AMD?,YOY growth is at 4% and the revenue estimates for 2024 were lowered. Did you even look at the earnings release?,1
17leoks,Thoughts on $AMD?,"yes I did. There is no 2024 guidance. She only mentioned an approximate extra 2 billions from MI300 next year

Also..  ""For the fourth quarter of 2023, AMD expects revenue to be approximately $6.1 billion, plus or minus $300 million. At the mid-point of the revenue range, this represents year-over-year growth of approximately 9%""

17leoks,Thoughts on $AMD?,The YOY growth is literally the first thing in the table once you open up the ER and it says clear as day 4%.,-2
17leoks,Thoughts on $AMD?,think there is some confusion between you two. From end of 3rd quarter 2022 to end of 3rd quarter 2023 the revenue growth was 4% but I think Covid is speak terms of 2022 overall revenue and 2023 overall revenue (with last quarter being what they expect to earn in the growth number),2
