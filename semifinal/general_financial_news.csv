These customers are reacting to the overall negative economic environment and poor consumer sentiment by focusing on reducing their in store inventory levels across many product categories including ours. We are also carrying excess inventories as the supply chain bottlenecks have eased resulting in a considerable influx of merchandise as we entered the third quarter. At Dorel Home this situation started in the second quarter and we responded with promotional activities in an effort to reduce inventory. The drop in orders at Dorel Juvenile in the U.S. was much more than we expected after what was a tremendous second quarter. This coupled with the U.S. dollar strengthening even more in the third quarter were the two biggest drivers of our underperformance. Further consumers in Europe are much more cautious due to the continued instability abroad and the particularly acute fall in the value of the Euro and Pound Sterling. As we move forward our focus for the balance of the year will be to drive sales to reduce inventories and generate cash to prepare for 2023 where we anticipate lower input costs and a return to more normal ordering levelsstated Dorel President & CEO Martin Schwartz.,0
