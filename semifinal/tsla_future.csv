1abv5ee,Routine Analysis of TSLA,2024-01-27 08:56:16,"Hahaha. You obviously know very little about economic fundamentals that drive stock prices. You aren't paying attention when you say almost no competition ahead.

Tesla has cut vehicle prices 3 times in 2023 due to losing market share due to competition. It's people like you who lose substantial sums of money in the stock market because you think,  but don't know basic fundamentals and economics. 

Knock yourself out.",-3

Imagine having to sit in your car for an hour in a blizzard.  At least it would be well heated inside.

* Charged $15k for FSD and is years behind on delivering on promises and possibly never will
* Talked a big game about robotaxis now that's vaporware
* Quality and workmanship issues with Tesla vehicles

**What no one is mentioning, is why its not obvious in the US yet**. We held tariffs so high (and we could debate if this may even be the primary reason), its kept China unable to start *destroying* market share here. Yet. Speculation...but this can't last:
- Elections will likely bring change
- Basic global economics
- Any sign of increasing inflation in data again  

If things go south in diplomacy more, and those 3 remain unchanged, that's arguably still a worse growth scenario for TSLA. Let's not think about a combined scenario where tarrifs could still be lowered...

**Musk knows all this, its why we now have the 'Next Gen' vehicle. Its just putting a marketing name on R&D that probably existed for 5 yrs**, but he knows smart investors see what I pointed out. Its meant to counter reality as much as possible, and franky even its the (1st?) timeline they hit, not likely going to be enough on its own to maintain growth that justifies even half of the current PE.

19fjwcz,TSLA for Long Term,2024-01-26 14:15:20,"I've been a long-term Tesla holder and recently questioned whether I've been wrong on this one. I think the next year or two might be rough, but long-term I think the upside could be massive.  
  
I drive both Tesla's and BYD's (for work) and although the range is similar, the brains of the vehicle are not comparable. The driver assist features of BYD are awful. FSD V12 looks super impressive, and crosses a barrier in terms of the entire approach. The switch to neural nets really is a game changer and I can't see how any other company could catch Tesla on this. The build quality, materials, and charging speeds of the cars are comparable.  
  
The optimus robots have some of the most impressive hardware we've seen from any robotics company. The difference between Tesla and others (e.g., Boston dynamics) is that Tesla actually knows how to manufacture for mass distribution. I've worked in product development, and this is where a lot of startups with competitive design and tech fail.  
  
Tesla is also yet to address the largest vehicle market, yet they still have the best selling car globally. A more affordable compact will boost sales to meet the forecast growth.  
  
I love what Elon does, but he is a bit of a bell end. If they didn't muck about with cybertruck they would of hit targets with a conventional truck, van etc. The tech unveiled in the CT is impressive though, and can be applied to other platforms.

NVDA - definitely a top performer in terms of growth in view of the AI waves

To clarify, I am not wanting to really buy Tesla around this price, currently. I think sentiment sucks, I think Elon could potentially find means to crater the stock. I think there is *a lot* to root for in this company, but the sharks of issues surrounding it means I would rather wait to see if there is a large discount after we potentially see a correction in the broader market.

Short term, however, I believe we see a large bounce, as one does in Tesla when it hits these levels of oversold on the hourly timeframe. We are talking <15 RSI on the 4h chart, and oversold on the Daily, more then 25% below the 200MA. There's a lot of calls here for a strong bounce >200 and possibly to 230 before the month is over. It's happened **many** times before with Tesla, and will likely happen again.

**That being said, lets look at then numbers.**

I see plenty of people here talking about how Tesla is doomed now and is ""just another car company now"" because BMW and Cadillac are both making EVs, which are both getting to Level 3 autonomous driving before Tesla. But just googling for five minutes will tell you that both of these companies are nowhere near positioned to overtake Tesla, and if anything they are in a better position for Tesla to just simply buy them out to shut them up.

These are all TTM for 2023, and I am simply going to just look at the range of prices for each companies **cheapest** EV options.

**Tesla**

Operating Margins - 14.3%

Tesla cars sold - 1.8 MILLION

Cheapest EV - Model 3 - $38 to $50k

Operating margin per vehicle - $5300 - $7150

**Cadillac**

Operating Margin - 6.98% **<<< Half of Tesla's operating margin**

Cars Sold TTM - 147k **<<< Less then 90% of Tesla's volume**

Cheapest EV - Lyriq - $57 to $61k **<<< 22% - 47%  More expensive than Tesla**

Operating margin per vehicle - $3970 - $4250 per Lyriq (?)

**BMW**

BMW Margins - 17.58% **<<< Better then Tesla**

Cars sold TTM - 360k <<< **Less then 70% of Tesla's volume**

BMW i4 - $52,200 - $61600 <<< **22% - 36%  more expensive then TEsla**

Operating margin per vehicle $9000 - $10829 <<< **Better then Tesla**

So, yeah, BMW makes more profit per vehicle but their volume is astoundingly less then Tesla, Tesla simply has the factories and the verticals to support their tremendous growth. And on top of that, Teslas are MUCH cheaper then both these two examples which I am seeing brought up multiple times in this chat.

Level 3 driving is great, but at least for BMW it's going to cost $6000 to install. What if Tesla decides to simply include it in their most expensive model trim at cost? It's going to be like $70k to get Level 3 in a BMW when a Tesla will let you have it for $55k? It's a no brainer. You buy Tesla.

I'm not even going to go into the charger stations. No ""car company"" is going to try and compete in that space. Tesla owns 58% of the charging station market. Any of these companies trying to compete against Tesla are still feeding into Tesla's margins because they will depend on them to charge their vehicles. Just wait until you see a day when traditional gas stations start implementing EV chargers throughout the midwest. Tesla will be the go-to.

Listen, i'm not a Tesla shill. But even outside of charging stations and EV vehicles, their other verticals still make billions and you don't even hear about them. So just be thankful when there's a dip because there is good reason to see Tesla being a 1 trillion dollar company this decade.

Edit: I also want to add, with Cadillac and BMW we don't even really know the margins for their EV line up yet. It will take at least a year until we can be confident that they are actually breaking any ground in profitability, or if they are straight up taking a loss at these prices.",18

If we're above value you short + sell calls.  If we're below value, you buy shares and sell puts. You can look a Vega which is implied vol. And try to make estimates on how far the market is pricing in future price moments and you can make informed trading decisions.  Is implied vol pricing in a 2% move, but the monthly VPOC IS 4% away in price? Then long volatility and short Theta.

Not Financial Adivce. High conviction play.

&#x200B;

1x Tesla is currently a horrendous value play in the short term to medium term due to speculative long term growth catalysts.

2. Tesla was expected to grow 50% over year next year.

3x Cars overpriced as shit compared to increasingly similar market counterparts. Hyundai Ioniq and Ford get similar milage

4x) Growth estimates started changing sometime in q3. Now currently expected 15% growth in revenue. Possible

5x) Other cars are expected, to grow fast in self driving.

6) Used cars saturating market.

7)Macro risks - CC/student loans(payments just started) at all time highs. Unemployment ticking up. Market at all time highs carried by chips. Fed rate hike lag effect.

8) Elon wants more shares

9) Sales causing more margins to reduce.

10) Losing marketshares overseas rapidly to china. BYD is oging to be a killer once it gets Auto driving.

People seem to focus on short term results, pitches around EPS, deliveries, FSD, Elon talking sh\*t.  But in reality...

Tesla is not a car company.  It is not even a tech company.

It is above all a makers company.   Invent, make, repeat.   If they can make it once, they can make it a million times.

They have patents.  They have engines, materials, batteries, heatpumps, they made an entire OS, they build their own chips, if there is no electromotor avaible for robots, it's no big deal, they will build one of their own, actuators, robots,  even processors and chips, not to mention AI.  And they know something about real estate and building stuff on a worldwide scale (factories, TSC), they have international awareness and presence.  It is a diversified stock in its own right and not a a stock from a risky niche EV car maker.  They are financially solid (7,3% debt to equity, any other ""carmaker""?).

It's a damn shame Americans do not endorse this gem more than they do now.

2 - technical analysis on this level, as in looking for chart patterns, is mostly worthless.

3 - this is a downtrend. lower highs, lower lows. nothing about this says its going to pop off. in fact until you make a higher high and probably confirm it with a higher low the downtrend remains intact.

if you wanted to buy in you should wait until you make a higher high than the previous high, then on the pull back you buy. 

but buying now is just speculating. youre just hoping it goes up. sure maybe it will go back up in a lower high. maybe thats what you mean about ""moon""",1

They made games that were awesome and didn’t follow a time table or work on monetization.  They just made really cool stuff and the money comes after.  That’s what Elon does.  He has two of the most innovative companies on the planet that aren’t just positioned to bring cash flow and have a fantastic balance sheet. They are there to make literally amazing innovation.  Just look at what spacex and tesla have accomplished in only the last 5 years!  You have to step back and realize they have gone from rockets blowing up on pads to launching hundreds of satellites in 5 years.  The Tesla was a “rich person “ near toy 5 years ago, now they have affordable models in the hands of so many people and the tech they are working on will change our society one day with self driving.

People have been repeating this for 15 years now. The truth is that he's always been extremely controversial, even before RDJ claimed he modeled his character after Elon. Ironically, Elon hadn't really accomplished a whole lot at that time, whereas he's become the childish business tycoon that Iron Man's character ultimately is. 

4 years ago, people were still up in arms about his ""going public @$420"" and ""pedo guy"" comments from 2018 and about to get *really* mad about his comments on COVID.

That's the difference between GM/ F and TSLA. TSLA has a lot more room to breathe with its cash position, which grew year over year.

I think Tesla is oversold. I think it's going to rebound and there might be some short-term pain. I feel like I've seen this playbook several times now with multiple tech companies.

The biggest automotive companies are trading at roughly 3-8 PE. Sure, Tesla had amazing growth in the past, but in the last one or two years they could only manage to roughly keep up their growth by significantly cutting margins and also 'saving money' by throwing out fundamental parts like parking sensors (which basically most mid- to premium cars had since the 2000'-s) from their cars. When Tesla-s growth slows down to the growth of other manufacturers (and this is a question of when, not if) then their PE will also come down to the 3-10 range. The only question is, when will this happen? I think that in the next 2-4 years or so, so at a PE of 60 they are still significantly overvalued and they may never reach their ATH again (or they might, but maybe in a couple of decades from now)",32

They just have a charging port. So like, it will be revenue but it will be arbitrage like gas stations. And gas stations are BARELY profitable when it comes to selling gas, more often than not scraping by or losing money. All the money in a gas station is made in the convenience store. So, not quite the W you think it is.


Tesla giving up it's chargers was actually a huge L since that was a massive asset to their brand.",5

But honestly Netflix has no ads, I just pay for it because it's there when I randomly decide I need background noise and there's no ads. I looked at other streaming but all of them have ads no matter what, or are ridiculously obnoxious (Disney+) and won't let me use it with VPN so just went back to the high seas.",1
19esf27,$TSLA earnings be trash,2024-01-25 22:17:36,"I'm referring to charging. Gas stations are barely profitable for independent owners and franchisees, not the franchise or company. 

Gas stations also require employees, gas storage, more land, etc.

Tesla doesn't franchise any of it out. They're getting government dollars to build them, while other manufacturers are switching to their port.

They also don't pay for the property or the electricity to charge them, so every charge is profit for Tesla.

It's not an L to their brand. It's a massive win for their company as we inch closer to EV becoming the dominant vehicle on roads.",0
19esf27,$TSLA earnings be trash,2024-01-25 22:48:55,"So, total Tesla rev was 95B.


Total supercharger rev was 88M so less than one percent.


They are owners of the charger but none of the land, when typicallyt that is the greatest asset, so there's that. They don't seem to be paying to place the chargers yet, but that will come likely. 


Still not seeing the massive W you seem to think is happening here.",4

>They don't seem to be paying to place the chargers yet, but that will come likely.

Revenue will continue to grow as more EVs are sold and more charging stations built.

Currently, only 9% of vehicles in the US are EV. 

Paying for charging station construction won't come until well after the infrastructure has been established and built.",-1

And now we see why: big miss on margins in particular. And that's not even including the January price-cuts that have already happened.

Forward guidance also looks like trash depending on how you interpret it:

> In 2024, our vehicle volume growth rate may be notably lower than the growth rate achieved in 2023, as our teams work on the launch of the next-generation vehicle at Gigafactory Texas. In 2024, the growth rate of deployments and revenue in our Energy Storage business should outpace the Automotive business

The first sentence implies less than 2.3mm cars, and maybe even less than 2.2mm (depending on how you interpret ""notably""). But the second sentence implies they might struggle to even hit 2mm.",25

You are entitled to your opinion, but I have found mine nothing but comfortable and convenient. And because of the SuperCharging network I've never had a problem or worried about charging.

And it is that SuperCharging network that I see becoming a bit of a cash cow as all other EV manufacturers are switching to the Tesla plug. Which also means they will have to buy access to the api's needed to access the network, in addition to folks having to pay for the electricity and use of them to charge.

And while I have little respect for Musk, he does have a lot of smart people working for him especially in technology.  The AI they are building around the 'self-driving' feature only keeps getting better. Trust me, there was a time when I wouldn't let my hands get more than inch off the wheel. Now, though I tend to keep my hand resting on the wheel, I am comfortable with it driving on the high way and it is getting better on city streets.

$0 revenue, day 2: $10 billion revenue. That’s not how companies work. 

You get into a field you slowly start making money in it before it can become as big as your main cash cow. You need years to lay out the infrastructure for it. 

To my knowledge Toyota is not in robotics, mass energy solutions or self driving AI. Heck, no one has as much driving data than Tesla. 

Here is a source to see how the Tesla energy business is doing. 

https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/10/22/tsla-energy-business-q3-earnings/ 

It’ll be foolish for us to think that it’ll be as big as their car business in a significantly shorter time compared to how long the car business has been running. But we can see the early signs in Tesla energy business that is is headed in a positive direction. 

I don’t see that direction from Toyota, GM, Ford etc. Again, have you ever been in a leadership position in a company? And led them into new markets? It really seems like you haven’t because it is never ever an overnight +$100 billion in revenue story.",1

19erjfw,$TSLA Earnings Thread,2024-01-28 10:19:42,"See this is the best thing about Reddit. Talking like this. 


Your presumption is wrong. I have and am in a leadership position. 

Let’s think this through. Just keep an open mind. 

How old is Tesla? Founded 2003. 

How old is Toyota ford and GM? Over ~100 years for ford and GM, Toyota a little less. 

Yet Tesla a company that is significantly younger than them is stealing sales from them. Look at model y sales in 2023. 

https://insideevs.com/news/706169/tesla-model-y-best-selling-car-2023/amp/

What were EVs before Tesla? Nothing. Prius and Nissan leaf was a joke. Everybody made fun of them. Now everyone is making electric cars. Tesla made that happen. 

They entered an unbelievably hard industry and completely changed the paradigm. GM, ford and toyota had all the money and brand name and yet never shifted to electric. 
It’s almost like this Elon guy has a track record of starting stuff (SpaceX, PayPal, Zip2,) and being successful with it. Pretty decent track record overall huh? Might be why he is so rich. 

With everything considered Tesla seems to have a track record of being successful with what they do. Again look at their impact on the car industry. 
The energy, robotics and FSD is extremely unbelievably early. Yet, you said it yourself, revenue growth within energy is great? So how about you give them a few more years? Try to think long term. 

It’s people like you who never had the vision to see them coming. Imagine if you invested in them in 2010, 2011, 2012 etc, instead of presuming failure and being a doubter haha. 

Look I could tell you never held any leadership positions to enter new markets and create mass amounts of value. If you did, you would know what I’m talking about.

Therefore, there's no real intelligence.

Tech companies understand this, but also know how much money there is in ""AI"" right now, so they're not going to be as open about how this wasn't really an ""AI breakthrough""

The public did not, and does not understand this. They are expecting an AI explosion with robots bringing you beer during the football game. I do not believe this will happen anytime soon.

One major thing to consider for this year and the next: Tesla is opening up the superchargers to other EVs that have the NACS adapter. In 2025, you will see EVs come out that natively have it. While opening them up is good for charging revenue, it democratizes the once exclusive Supercharger experience.

He had an invisible hand in the form of Gov to subsidize/support his companies, Tesla and SpaceX  both. SpaceX success is solely because of Gwynne, who is President and COO. She is the one who was able to earn those sweet Gov contracts which others had failed in private industry. Without that SpaceX was fucked.

Similarly US Gov introduced incentives and subsidies on electric vehicles which helped Tesla break cover.

And Elons contribution? He literally made production halt in factories of his genius ideas to fully automated and speed up his factories which led to several disruptions and his operations lead taking a leave for several months due to extreme stress. He also had engineers remove radars and move to pure vision for FSD, a disaster which has caused FSD to become most unreliable in the market right now. His leads on AI managing FSD have recently left the company as well.

Yes, at a lower margin, because they aren’t benefiting from economies of scale of having a single model of vehicle.

Economies of scale are absolutely a factor because you have different parts for different models of cars. Do you really think Toyota prefers to sell dozens of different models of cars as opposed to fewer models?

They can't scale. There's still room for growth in the market, but without massive government investment in infrastructure to support them, there is a cap on the amount of electric vehicles we can have going. 

That said, until recently(ish), China was the dark horse market. But now it doesn't particularly matter because Chinese manufacturers have stepped up their game and last I saw, Xi wasn't as big a fan of Elon anymore.
