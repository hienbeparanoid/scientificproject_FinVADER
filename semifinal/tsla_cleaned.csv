- Basic global economics

19fjwcz,TSLA for Long Term,2024-01-26 14:15:20,"I've been a long-term Tesla holder and recently questioned whether I've been wrong on this one. I think the next year or two might be rough, but long-term I think the upside could be massive.  
  
I drive both Tesla's and BYD's (for work) and although the range is similar, the brains of the vehicle are not comparable. The driver assist features of BYD are awful. FSD V12 looks super impressive, and crosses a barrier in terms of the entire approach. The switch to neural nets really is a game changer and I can't see how any other company could catch Tesla on this. The build quality, materials, and charging speeds of the cars are comparable.  
  
The optimus robots have some of the most impressive hardware we've seen from any robotics company. The difference between Tesla and others (e.g., Boston dynamics) is that Tesla actually knows how to manufacture for mass distribution. I've worked in product development, and this is where a lot of startups with competitive design and tech fail.  
  
Tesla is also yet to address the largest vehicle market, yet they still have the best selling car globally. A more affordable compact will boost sales to meet the forecast growth.  
  
I love what Elon does, but he is a bit of a bell end. If they didn't muck about with cybertruck they would of hit targets with a conventional truck, van etc. The tech unveiled in the CT is impressive though, and can be applied to other platforms.

1ac2alg,"TSLA: ""No floor""",2024-01-27 15:45:06,"Okay so I want to give some input here from just fifteen minutes of research since I am seeing a lot of shit being tossed around without any data, and ontop of that I have $600 in tesla calls for next month so I want to see for myself.

To clarify, I am not wanting to really buy Tesla around this price, currently. I think sentiment sucks, I think Elon could potentially find means to crater the stock. I think there is *a lot* to root for in this company, but the sharks of issues surrounding it means I would rather wait to see if there is a large discount after we potentially see a correction in the broader market.

Short term, however, I believe we see a large bounce, as one does in Tesla when it hits these levels of oversold on the hourly timeframe. We are talking <15 RSI on the 4h chart, and oversold on the Daily, more then 25% below the 200MA. There's a lot of calls here for a strong bounce >200 and possibly to 230 before the month is over. It's happened **many** times before with Tesla, and will likely happen again.

**That being said, lets look at then numbers.**

I see plenty of people here talking about how Tesla is doomed now and is ""just another car company now"" because BMW and Cadillac are both making EVs, which are both getting to Level 3 autonomous driving before Tesla. But just googling for five minutes will tell you that both of these companies are nowhere near positioned to overtake Tesla, and if anything they are in a better position for Tesla to just simply buy them out to shut them up.

These are all TTM for 2023, and I am simply going to just look at the range of prices for each companies **cheapest** EV options.

**Tesla**

Operating Margins - 14.3%

Tesla cars sold - 1.8 MILLION

Cheapest EV - Model 3 - $38 to $50k

Operating margin per vehicle - $5300 - $7150

**Cadillac**

Operating Margin - 6.98% **<<< Half of Tesla's operating margin**

Cars Sold TTM - 147k **<<< Less then 90% of Tesla's volume**

Cheapest EV - Lyriq - $57 to $61k **<<< 22% - 47%  More expensive than Tesla**

Operating margin per vehicle - $3970 - $4250 per Lyriq (?)

**BMW**

BMW Margins - 17.58% **<<< Better then Tesla**

Cars sold TTM - 360k <<< **Less then 70% of Tesla's volume**

BMW i4 - $52,200 - $61600 <<< **22% - 36%  more expensive then TEsla**

Operating margin per vehicle $9000 - $10829 <<< **Better then Tesla**

So, yeah, BMW makes more profit per vehicle but their volume is astoundingly less then Tesla, Tesla simply has the factories and the verticals to support their tremendous growth. And on top of that, Teslas are MUCH cheaper then both these two examples which I am seeing brought up multiple times in this chat.

Level 3 driving is great, but at least for BMW it's going to cost $6000 to install. What if Tesla decides to simply include it in their most expensive model trim at cost? It's going to be like $70k to get Level 3 in a BMW when a Tesla will let you have it for $55k? It's a no brainer. You buy Tesla.

I'm not even going to go into the charger stations. No ""car company"" is going to try and compete in that space. Tesla owns 58% of the charging station market. Any of these companies trying to compete against Tesla are still feeding into Tesla's margins because they will depend on them to charge their vehicles. Just wait until you see a day when traditional gas stations start implementing EV chargers throughout the midwest. Tesla will be the go-to.

Listen, i'm not a Tesla shill. But even outside of charging stations and EV vehicles, their other verticals still make billions and you don't even hear about them. So just be thankful when there's a dip because there is good reason to see Tesla being a 1 trillion dollar company this decade.

Edit: I also want to add, with Cadillac and BMW we don't even really know the margins for their EV line up yet. It will take at least a year until we can be confident that they are actually breaking any ground in profitability, or if they are straight up taking a loss at these prices.",18,Okay so I want to give

Not Financial Adivce. High conviction play.

&#x200B;

1x Tesla is currently a horrendous value play in the short term to medium term due to speculative long term growth catalysts.

2. Tesla was expected to grow 50% over year next year.

3x Cars overpriced as shit compared to increasingly similar market counterparts. Hyundai Ioniq and Ford get similar milage

4x) Growth estimates started changing sometime in q3. Now currently expected 15% growth in revenue. Possible

5x) Other cars are expected, to grow fast in self driving.

6) Used cars saturating market.

7)Macro risks - CC/student loans(payments just started) at all time highs. Unemployment ticking up. Market at all time highs carried by chips. Fed rate hike lag effect.

8) Elon wants more shares

9) Sales causing more margins to reduce.

10) Losing marketshares overseas rapidly to china. BYD is oging to be a killer once it gets Auto driving.

People seem to focus on short term results, pitches around EPS, deliveries, FSD, Elon talking sh\*t.  But in reality...

Tesla is not a car company.  It is not even a tech company.

It is above all a makers company.   Invent, make, repeat.   If they can make it once, they can make it a million times.

They have patents.  They have engines, materials, batteries, heatpumps, they made an entire OS, they build their own chips, if there is no electromotor avaible for robots, it's no big deal, they will build one of their own, actuators, robots,  even processors and chips, not to mention AI.  And they know something about real estate and building stuff on a worldwide scale (factories, TSC), they have international awareness and presence.  It is a diversified stock in its own right and not a a stock from a risky niche EV car maker.  They are financially solid (7,3% debt to equity, any other ""carmaker""?).

Retail investors get worked up over ER’s like this, but the institutional money that actually moves the stock price is looking farther out.

You are entitled to your opinion, but I have found mine nothing but comfortable and convenient. And because of the SuperCharging network I've never had a problem or worried about charging.

And it is that SuperCharging network that I see becoming a bit of a cash cow as all other EV manufacturers are switching to the Tesla plug. Which also means they will have to buy access to the api's needed to access the network, in addition to folks having to pay for the electricity and use of them to charge.

And while I have little respect for Musk, he does have a lot of smart people working for him especially in technology.  The AI they are building around the 'self-driving' feature only keeps getting better. Trust me, there was a time when I wouldn't let my hands get more than inch off the wheel.

Your presumption is wrong. I have and am in a leadership position. 

Let’s think this through. Just keep an open mind. 

How old is Tesla? Founded 2003. 

How old is Toyota ford and GM? Over ~100 years for ford and GM, Toyota a little less. 

Yet Tesla a company that is significantly younger than them is stealing sales from them. Look at model y sales in 2023. 

https://insideevs.com/news/706169/tesla-model-y-best-selling-car-2023/amp/

What were EVs before Tesla? Nothing. Prius and Nissan leaf was a joke. Everybody made fun of them. Now everyone is making electric cars. Tesla made that happen. 

They entered an unbelievably hard industry and completely changed the paradigm. GM, ford and toyota had all the money and brand name and yet never shifted to electric. 
It’s almost like this Elon guy has a track record of starting stuff (SpaceX, PayPal, Zip2,) and being successful with it. Pretty decent track record overall huh? Might be why he is so rich. 

With everything considered Tesla seems to have a track record of being successful with what they do. Again look at their impact on the car industry. 
The energy, robotics and FSD is extremely unbelievably early. Yet, you said it yourself, revenue growth within energy is great? So how about you give them a few more years? Try to think long term. 

It’s people like you who never had the vision to see them coming. Imagine if you invested in them in 2010, 2011, 2012 etc, instead of presuming failure and being a doubter haha.

One major thing to consider for this year and the next: Tesla is opening up the superchargers to other EVs that have the NACS adapter. In 2025, you will see EVs come out that natively have it.
