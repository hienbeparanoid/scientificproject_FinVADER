Tesla has cut vehicle prices 3 times in 2023 due to losing market share due to competition. It's people like you who lose substantial sums of money in the stock market because you think,  but don't know basic fundamentals and economics.

4. BABA as a whole might not be around 5 years later, but the payment system is hard to beat in China when digital wallets are the normal. BABA allows you to use foreign account digitally to pay when in China. The Chinese do not jump ship that easily, hence why Apple Pay is not super popular in China. Alipay has a Google like effect in China and has more room to run. 
5. Jack Ma will not let his company fail, he’s acting in the shadows for his family’s safety. He’s still calling the shots at BABA and biding his time.

2) It’s hard to see how the dividend yield of less than 2% for the Chinese-based company is going to attract income investors when they have much better risk-free alternatives closer to home.
3) At the same time, the buyback program has been ongoing since 2021, but that didn’t stop the shares from depreciating even more. 
4) The founder Jack Ma is leaving Alibaba
5) The negative market reaction to Alibaba’s latest earnings results indicates that the new geopolitical reality with heightened macro risks will continue to be more important for investors than the company’s fundamentals. What’s more, is that it appears that there’s nothing that the company’s management can do to change the situation.

Okay. You are saying Twitter turned a profit for a couple of years and not others because of legal troubles. This was during the biggest economic boom in recent memory. 0% ffr, everyone trapped in their houses increasing Internet usage, and lots of helicopter money. Now it's been a year and the script has flipped. We have a 5% ffr and economic conditions are restrictive. What kind of quarterly loss are they taking right now? 

>His other companies are successful because they've attracted great talent and then built up a layer of management to manage Elon - run with his good ideas and ignore his bad ideas. 

This could very well be true. I don't work directly for him so I have no idea. That said, whatever methodology he uses, it's been extremely successful. 


>He is like a virus, and those companies had time to grow an immune response to him.

Don't think this is a fair statement.  Virus implies he is net negative. If that was the case and companies were being successful despite him damaging, then ceo would be a meaningless position. Why aren't other companies pulling Jon Does off the street to build trillion dollar companies... Why is it that whenever he gets involved, amazing companies are built...

>At Twitter, he fired all of the experts and he's just flailing around digging the hole deeper.

You mean he cut all the fat and brought out his own software people to review the product? Did he cut to much initially? Yes. Was this type of change needed for success? Also yes. The company was hemorrhaging money. 


At the end of the day, I'm very happy that he was willing to take the platform over. He has provided a town square that might not be perfect, but is far better than anything else around.

I drive both Tesla's and BYD's (for work) and although the range is similar, the brains of the vehicle are not comparable. The driver assist features of BYD are awful. FSD V12 looks super impressive, and crosses a barrier in terms of the entire approach. The switch to neural nets really is a game changer and I can't see how any other company could catch Tesla on this. The build quality, materials, and charging speeds of the cars are comparable.  
  
The optimus robots have some of the most impressive hardware we've seen from any robotics company. The difference between Tesla and others (e.g., Boston dynamics) is that Tesla actually knows how to manufacture for mass distribution. I've worked in product development, and this is where a lot of startups with competitive design and tech fail.  
  
Tesla is also yet to address the largest vehicle market, yet they still have the best selling car globally. A more affordable compact will boost sales to meet the forecast growth.  
  
I love what Elon does, but he is a bit of a bell end. If they didn't muck about with cybertruck they would of hit targets with a conventional truck, van etc. The tech unveiled in the CT is impressive though, and can be applied to other platforms.

As far as I can tell the vast majority of people with Cybertrucks right now are either: 

* Tesla employees (this is a common practice in the auto industry to help iron out any last minute production issues by selling early production vehicles to employees at a discount)

I think we need to find another market that utilizes what we have learned so far. What will most likely happen is that AI will reveal new usecases that will produce new markets. The last 20 years of digital innovation is a technological revolution that has changed the world so much that I sometimes feel like my childhood in the 90s was a different life. To see the same growth again, we need another technological revolution, but I doubt it will be in entertainment and work productivity which is the primary driver for the past 20 years of technological advancements. But there are plenty of markets that have yet to be modernised with the technology we have today. Example; personal health, psychology, education, finance, to name a few. 

Here is an example of a product I would pay for; a monthly subscription to get AI to analyse my body metrics in order to give me health feedback, discover sickness or cancer early and generally help me make good decisions before a doctor tells me im sick. 

Another product I would pay for is something like Blueprint by Bryan Johnson which is health and food guides that atleast seem to not be based on bullshit, because 9/10 health-meal companies sell you a scam product for profit. 

An important product that we have forgotten about since corona is green energy. A lot of these companies have been beaten to death by the markets, yet the problem it wants to solve still persists. If we dont do anything than 5 years from now when we are close to he 2030 deadline, a lot of people will get a reality check. Cant become a stock market millionaire or billionaire if half the world is in flames due to constant natural disasters. 

Finally, the digital age has brought with it a quantized world. I think the next step is to bring individual quality into the mix. There are plenty of areas where the individual quality has died out the past 30 years. Education, medical help, psychological help, societal empathy, just to name a few. Research is showing that from a human aspect of health, especially mental health, we are in a not very good spot currently. So whoever figures out how to modernize and digitalize quality improvements in human wel-being will have a really strong moat for becoming a giant billion dollar company. 

Generallty, I think the past 15 years has showed a lot of people that you cant really trust any big company. META and GOOGLE has more or less built empires on using people as revenue. Food industry has been screwing up the general public for over 50 years now, and the health of nature is on a thin lifeline. Zoomers and millenials are generally much more health oriented, working out more, eating healthier and paying more for environmentally friendly options. I think a big market driver in the future will be in products that sell quality, honesty and health to this generation.",4

Dude I know you're a Cardowno holder and all, but surely you can see how you contradict yourself right there.

If NVDA has a pattern of going up to $500 and then dropping, and then retesting $500 and then dropping again.....

Then even an ADA fanboy such as yourself must realize that means buying less then $500 (like $480 for example, in case you don't know how numbers work) would be the smart play. Not waiting until it's $500 to buy. 

Since... You know..... The $500 price is where NVDA generally peaks.

I know this is a hard concept for someone who buys dog themed fake internet money to understand, but an investor is supposed to buy low and sell high. 

Not buy NVDA when it's at a record high and then sell when it inevitably drops down in price

Super advanced concept, I know.",2

1aor79h,Thoughts on TSLA tomorrow?,2024-02-13 09:01:09,"Here’s the thing- I wouldn’t pay for FSD but AP is such a game changer for daily commutes (I now WFH but was awesome when I had a 45 minute commute) and I never had any issues. As a matter of fact it actively avoided someone entering my lane that I did not notice twice. 

I definitely agree with what you’re saying but the “recall” (interesting term for a free OTA update but ok) was essentially that the system worked TOO well and allowed drivers to not pay enough attention. Now, one thing I think should be forced on them is to include stop sign/light interaction in standard AP. As it is now, if you don’t pay for FSD, it will visualize the stop sign approaching and prompt you but if you ignore the prompt it will essentially say “ok well let’s go to Valhalla together” and won’t stop because you didn’t pay $15k. IMO if you are enabling a car to drive itself to that extent and it fully is capable of stopping at a stop sign, you should have to provide that to the user.",1

wtf lol, didnt know that. yeah definitely seems like something that you shouldn't be able to freemium. I hear you on AP, i only have adaptive cruise that I use on my VW but that has easily made it my favorite daily.",1
