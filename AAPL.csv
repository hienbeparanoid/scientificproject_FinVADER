17sz3xi,Trying to understand this chart. Massive AAPL buy at 4 PM. But prices don't seem to synch with chart. 1. What was the actual closing price? 2. Why would a trading algorithm continue to buy at increasing higher prices? 3. How could you have played that trade? Is it even possible to get in? . :-),"Looks fine to me. The large institutional investors that use Apex Clearing House as their trade desk have designated windows for trading of their mutual funds and index funds to reflect inflows and outflows. Because AAPL is such a large part of SPY and so many other indexes, direct investors who need inflows reflected by COB (close of business) execute this way. It's complex, but it has to do with the float of shares Apex and other clearing houses have sitting around and what they have to go and acquire that they don't have to manage orders that come in. For reference, a huge volume of orders come in to the clearinghouses at 2:30ET every trading day and they have to get float moved and trades placed and executed by market close.",13

Government downgrades from S&P and Fitch. 

Bank downgrades from moody's and S&P.

Credit card debt is at highest in history. And did I mention that the interest rates are high?

fears of china banning iphones, That one is murky, but the fear is real. 

Aging population, less people paying into retirement plans and more people moving to bonds and retiring. A fair chunk of the last huge rally was the boomers that didn't save for retirement trying to cram. I know guys who were contributing 40% to to their 401k... As they switch to zero contributions to the market, it's going to soften. 

And did I mention that even retail traders can get over 5% interest with no risk? Reducing the incentive to invest...

Buffet is holding a TON of cash. If you're into the oracle thing.

Regardless of how dumb that is, it refuted zero of what my claim was. No one said that Niger halted uranium supplies. Simply that Uranium is important and the French have been depressing the price for financial gain and cheaper European energy.

The government clearly believes that this can have an impact and they need to pivot the supply chain. They‚Äôre talking about energy independence because they see the Niger coup as volatility that could further increase EU energy prices. Couple that with a SHARP increase in uranium prices and it is obvious what is going on.

Please go away. People have been writing about the price discrenpency for decades. Either you‚Äôre dumb, work for the uranium company or the French government - in any case I‚Äôll enjoy taking a profit.

There is literally zero indication that Apple has any revolutionary AI projects in the works. They were caught with their pants down when ChatGPT came out and now they are dumping tons of money into AI trying to catch up to the competition. Right now it seems like their major projects are to improve Siri and improve sentence auto-complete in iMessages using AI. They also have projects to add an equivalent of Github Copilot to Xcode, and some features for things like auto-generated playlists in Apple Music. They are already behind the competition in all of these areas, just dumping money into trying to avoid being left in the dust. None of these projects will bring in additional revenue, and if done poorly could severely hurt the Apple eco-system.

Basically at this point AI is a massive cost sink to Apple with no hope of profits in sight. AI is one of the worst things that could have happened to Apple, and it is a very real possibility that it could impact their bottom line in the long run. The Apple that was an innovator and disruptor in the tech space is long gone, dead with Steve Jobs.

This is the safer option to selling a ‚Äúnaked call‚Äù which is where you sell the option, but if the stock closes at the strike you sold the call for then you will have to buy 100 shares of that stock to cover your end of the bargain which is very expensive if you don‚Äôt have the cash.

The risk in this situation is that your will limit your gains for Apple if it closes above $195 a share by next month. But the call will cover your up to $200/share. If it closes below $195 you will not have to sell the shares.

On the other AAPL has appreciated a lot more.  But I suspect if I had not bought the house I still would have sold some AAPL just to make rent in those difficult years.  And it‚Äôs a great house. So I don‚Äôt worry about it too much. 

A few years later I needed a new car. I thought about selling $30k of my APPL to pay for it. But instead I bought the car on a three year lease.  Three years later I had paid $30k, but the $30k of AAPL I would have sold to pay for it at the beginning had grown to $120k. So in the end I made $90k and I got a free car.

I followed the presentation and there was nothing of real substance there. They talked about things like how fuzzy their fake leather is. That's a joke.

I used Android phones with iPhones and always came back to iPhones. What has made my switch permanent is the Google Pixel 7. At that point Google and Android has become very good. I use a Samsung S7Plus tablet and now with Dex 6 it is utterly incredible. 

The only Apple devices I still use are their notebooks and mac mini. Those were when I purchased them very good value and very affordable if you do an apples to apples comparison. But with the last release of  the new Macbook Pros I realized that I will be switching computers sometime in the future. They are overpricing their stuff and that is wrong. 

What I am saying is that Apple is sitting on its laurels way too long. Tim Cook is great when it comes to being a bean counter. But his innovation track record sucks. I can understand why Ives left. The culture has changed and Cook needs to go.

There are a lot of flaws with that thinking. 

Tech stocks went up 20% because they lost that much the year before. Look at AMZN  or Google over 5 years.

If you do fundamental analysis, their chance of future growth isn't that big. They trade often at high valuations, just because they are big. If you think their business model is a chance for growth and the price is justified, buy. But don't buy because they are big, tech and just made up 30% they lost before.

VOO Holdings:

AAPL - 6.96%

MSFT - 6.49%

Googl - 2.15%

INTC - 0.41%

AMZN - 3.19%

Nah. Realistically the censorship isn't going to actually drive many people away. It's really to make the perform more ad friendly. If they get serious about blocking ad blockers that will also be a nice boost to RPU and reduce costs a little bit. And YouTube premium is growing very fast.

One of the things that fascinates me is how such a behemoth of a company grew to that size without making anything. I have never owned a physical product made by google. They are far from market leaders in the enterprise sector (AWS, Azure, Salesforce) but yet their business productivity suite continue to chug along. I have never paid for youtube and haven't paid a dime for my gmail account that is old enough to apply for a driver's license. It boggles my mind how much money a search engine, user data collection and targeted ad revenue can balloon. Truly some peak consumerism sht.

People have said I'm crazy for this take, but what would google do in a recession? A real recession or even prolonged stagflation. The first thing that falls is the advertising industry. If you think about it Google doesn't produce or own much of anything that isn't completely codependent on advertising revenue. People I've had this thought experiment with are quick to say that google owns the biggest media content platform ever. They aren't wrong, that ship could drink a lot of water before it would ever sink, but that platform has been a cash cow only by the merciful teet of advertising dollars. Google no doubt must know this. I think their recent initiative in attempt to get in on the short video format space that no one wants and even more recent initiative to convert users with Adblockers on youtube to convert them in to premium subscribers could be a tell future projections on what was once reliable revenue streams might be slowing down. By no means do I think google would be doomed they are a lot more than just youtube, but from an investing standpoint I could never justify entering a position after the great slingshot of covid 19.

First and foremost, at the consumer level we have a watered down version of utilizing current advancements in AI for our own musings through things like ChatGPT, Dall-E, etc.

I do not think that this is where the market is heading, but giving plebs like us a few new toys to mess with isn't creating any real harm.

Most big tech companies have what would be considered just a couple decades past a monopoly. The reason we don't hear much of startups in this space is they are literally just acquired and gobbled up by the big players in the space as soon as something innovative hits the market. Apple is acquiring companies at a rate of about 90 per annum, you can view Google's more recent acquisitions [on Wiki](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mergers_and_acquisitions_by_Alphabet) which details a severe market uptick in AI, analytics, and robotics.

Unless you are an ""insider"" you probably won't hear too much on these advancements, as big tech acquires most of these companies before they come to market for an end user.

If you want to look at what technologies AI is being used for, look no further than CIA funding. Palantir is a decent example of a CIA funded startup that is now publicly traded.

You can also look at a CIA finance arm's offerings [here](https://www.iqt.org/portfolio/). Occasionally looking at the startups there, a certain air of dystopian future can arise.

Big data, big analytics, and big surveillance are a despot's wet dream, and as more developing nations increase internet access for their populations, these tools will become even more pervasive.

Not all redundancies in big tech will come directly from AI, but automation of historically human jobs is certainly in the pipeline. One needs to look no further than their local supermarket in the western world to see machines fulfilling the past roles of cashiers. 

It is speculated that Microsoft is using individual user data to train it's [AI models](https://mspoweruser.com/personal-data-to-train-ai/) after a recent change in their privacy policy.

While we may not see the ramifications of these moves for a couple years, it's safe to assume that big tech wielding such an extensive collection of user data that can be parsed through AI models is going to be seriously fucking lucrative, likely at the expense of the general public.

If you want a glimpse of the dystopian promiseland envisioned by big tech and government, check out Henry Kissinger and former Google CEO Eric Schmidt's book ""The Age of AI.""

18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,I love how they change the word retiring to leaving. Makes it sound much worse.,1872

18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,"Ok, but why is every model is this picture a 14 Pro? 12 Pro has a much smaller camera cutout, 13 Pro has a more yellow flash, and 15 Pro has a smaller top left lens and thinner metal bezel around the outside.

18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,"Iphone design has got very similar to razor design. When you run out of ideas, just add another blade/camera. Iphone 20 is a must buy. Why though? IT HAS 13 FVCKING CAMERAS, THATS WHY!",1

18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,Lol come on they‚Äôre similar but posting fake stuff is silly. The camera bump area is 100% not the same size across all 4 of these generations. This is just a promo shot of the same model.,1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,Yes the design didn‚Äôt change but the picture is bulshit too. The camera bump of the 12 pro was smaller than the 13 pro.,1

18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,"I mean, this happens with a lot of design for fairly new products. Look at skateboards and snowboards for instance. When they were first thought up, no one really knew what people‚Äôs capability or needs would be with them. This led to wildly different and specialized attempts at designs as people started to figure it out, and competing brands would look totally different with each new innovation slowly making their way into all of the different products. Then, you basically reach an equilibrium where it‚Äôs more or less been figured out and the form-factor is clear. We are basically there with smartphones currently. The biggest question on the horizon right now: is bendable OLED tech robust enough for years of rugged use, so as not to be a roadblock for more compact foldable phones (or will people want this).",1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,People catching on lol...fuck apple,1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,They gave up pretending to innovate. Just just sell people the same phone with a different number on it.,1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,We‚Äôre long past the point where a new phone model each year is warranted.,1

18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,"I don‚Äôt think the design is a problem, it‚Äôs looks/feels nice.

18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,Since iPhone plans each years design years prior he probably saw no light at the end of the tunnel,1

18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,"based on your image, I'd say he left about 4 iPhone models ago. He definitely stopped updating the design and kept turning in the same spec and technical drawings",1

18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,judging by how much (or rather little) the products change from generation to generation  no one will notice his departure for quite some time,1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,"There‚Äôs so much potential here for their design development:
 
- Remove the camera bumps

- Actually give the option for an SD card

- similar to androids, re introduce the option for a fingerprint scanner as part of the volume rocker or a side finger print scanner (I miss having the option)

- a headphone jack. It‚Äôs ridiculous, it‚Äôs 2023 and I have to use adaptors for everything to dual charge (listen to music while charging my phone in the car) amongst other silly inconveniences. It‚Äôs wild to me that the general public - mostly in USA I find - will defend it also. ‚ÄúOh well everything is Bluetooth just get a Bluetooth‚Äù the fact is when that fails and always does, the option for hardwired connection is always preferred. It‚Äôs very cheap to add a headphone jack and phones muchhhh cheaper than an iPhone today have one. 

The list goes on. But I need to keep my android tucked away because people complain too much about creating group chats and not being about to iMessage you if you‚Äôre not in the IOS community. The one and only reason I still have an iPhone is iMessage but it‚Äôs growing old. The convenience is nice of having an iPhone, but I prefer having an Android as my daily device. iPhone just makes it easier for me to communicate with family who live abroad and where I live the networks are terrible, wifi communication has saved us with iMessage. Especially for people who don‚Äôt have Facebook or won‚Äôt use what‚Äôsapp, I‚Äôve always appreciated imessage as a service. I wish it was an app available for use on Android. 

I miss having my android and the flexibility. I miss the battery life, even on $100-$200 android phones is better than an iPhone. I‚Äôm getting very tired of throwing away money on a new battery that dies out way too quickly and/or new hardware every couple of years I really don‚Äôt need but am forced into because the old devices start working less performance and battery wise. The devices are so expensive and don‚Äôt even have a headphone jack. 

It‚Äôs criminal at this point and beyond the iPhone 13, I don‚Äôt see myself getting a new iPhone not even the 15 any time soon. I‚Äôm upset they are also introducing ESIM beyond the 14 models. I‚Äôm okay with having a SIM card.",1

iPhones with titanium bodies will have to do a lot more thermal throttling on the CPU to compensate. That's just facts.
