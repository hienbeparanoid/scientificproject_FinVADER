17sz3xi,Trying to understand this chart. Massive AAPL buy at 4 PM. But prices don't seem to synch with chart. 1. What was the actual closing price? 2. Why would a trading algorithm continue to buy at increasing higher prices? 3. How could you have played that trade? Is it even possible to get in? . :-),"Looks fine to me. The large institutional investors that use Apex Clearing House as their trade desk have designated windows for trading of their mutual funds and index funds to reflect inflows and outflows. Because AAPL is such a large part of SPY and so many other indexes, direct investors who need inflows reflected by COB (close of business) execute this way. It's complex, but it has to do with the float of shares Apex and other clearing houses have sitting around and what they have to go and acquire that they don't have to manage orders that come in. For reference, a huge volume of orders come in to the clearinghouses at 2:30ET every trading day and they have to get float moved and trades placed and executed by market close.",13

It almost looks like a software glitch. But it's not. Would the exchange just ignore it? You would have to flip your trades in seconds. And would do great. Seems too easy.

Government shutdown looming and congress taking a 3 day weekend. 

Government downgrades from S&P and Fitch. 

Bank downgrades from moody's and S&P. 

People are starting to realize that lower inflation doesn't mean deflation, and high costs are here to stay. 

Credit card debt is at highest in history. And did I mention that the interest rates are high?

fears of china banning iphones, That one is murky, but the fear is real. 

Aging population, less people paying into retirement plans and more people moving to bonds and retiring. A fair chunk of the last huge rally was the boomers that didn't save for retirement trying to cram. I know guys who were contributing 40% to to their 401k... As they switch to zero contributions to the market, it's going to soften. 

And did I mention that even retail traders can get over 5% interest with no risk? Reducing the incentive to invest...

Buffet is holding a TON of cash. If you're into the oracle thing.

On top of Russian oil/gas… they are also one of the leading producers of uranium for energy along with Niger - who just told France to pound sand. France was forcing them to sell their uranium for 0.80Euro/kg and they will now raise the price to 200Euro/kg. Russia at the same time withheld uranium shipments to the west.

Regardless of how dumb that is, it refuted zero of what my claim was. No one said that Niger halted uranium supplies. Simply that Uranium is important and the French have been depressing the price for financial gain and cheaper European energy.

https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20230801-does-the-coup-in-niger-threaten-nuclear-power-plants-in-france

https://www.oxfam.org/en/press-releases/areva-niger-who-benefiting-uranium

https://reliefweb.int/report/niger/niger-uranium-blessing-or-curse

The government clearly believes that this can have an impact and they need to pivot the supply chain. They’re talking about energy independence because they see the Niger coup as volatility that could further increase EU energy prices. Couple that with a SHARP increase in uranium prices and it is obvious what is going on.

Please go away. People have been writing about the price discrenpency for decades. Either you’re dumb, work for the uranium company or the French government - in any case I’ll enjoy taking a profit.

God I have to keep editing this because it is so easy to show… take a look at a physical Uranium fund - SRUUF, URA, NLR - in the last month it has gone straight up with good volume.

There is literally zero indication that Apple has any revolutionary AI projects in the works. They were caught with their pants down when ChatGPT came out and now they are dumping tons of money into AI trying to catch up to the competition. Right now it seems like their major projects are to improve Siri and improve sentence auto-complete in iMessages using AI. They also have projects to add an equivalent of Github Copilot to Xcode, and some features for things like auto-generated playlists in Apple Music. They are already behind the competition in all of these areas, just dumping money into trying to avoid being left in the dust. None of these projects will bring in additional revenue, and if done poorly could severely hurt the Apple eco-system.

Basically at this point AI is a massive cost sink to Apple with no hope of profits in sight. AI is one of the worst things that could have happened to Apple, and it is a very real possibility that it could impact their bottom line in the long run. The Apple that was an innovator and disruptor in the tech space is long gone, dead with Steve Jobs. The company is currently being run by bean counters and that doesn't bode well in the rapidly shifting landscape of technology today.",17

18fe0a8,Sell or Hold $AAPL?,"Covered calls is a strategy related to options where you can sell a call contract for every 100 shares of Apple you own.

This is the safer option to selling a “naked call” which is where you sell the option, but if the stock closes at the strike you sold the call for then you will have to buy 100 shares of that stock to cover your end of the bargain which is very expensive if you don’t have the cash.

If you sold a 195 strong call for next month expiration, you would get $490 in premium for every contract. Thats 2.5% return on $19,500 of stock for one month which I consider a good return. 

The risk in this situation is that your will limit your gains for Apple if it closes above $195 a share by next month. But the call will cover your up to $200/share. If it closes below $195 you will not have to sell the shares.

If you’re up $50k on 200% return then I’m assuming you probably have around 130 shares at $50/share? In that case you’re essentially risk free on your money until the stock so you shouldn’t be concerned if the option gets exercised and you have to sell it",6

I followed the presentation and there was nothing of real substance there. They talked about things like how fuzzy their fake leather is. That's a joke.

I used Android phones with iPhones and always came back to iPhones. What has made my switch permanent is the Google Pixel 7. At that point Google and Android has become very good. I use a Samsung S7Plus tablet and now with Dex 6 it is utterly incredible. 

The only Apple devices I still use are their notebooks and mac mini. Those were when I purchased them very good value and very affordable if you do an apples to apples comparison. But with the last release of  the new Macbook Pros I realized that I will be switching computers sometime in the future. They are overpricing their stuff and that is wrong. 

What I am saying is that Apple is sitting on its laurels way too long. Tim Cook is great when it comes to being a bean counter. But his innovation track record sucks. I can understand why Ives left. The culture has changed and Cook needs to go.

There are a lot of flaws with that thinking. 

Tech stocks went up 20% because they lost that much the year before. Look at AMZN  or Google over 5 years.

If you do fundamental analysis, their chance of future growth isn't that big. They trade often at high valuations, just because they are big. If you think their business model is a chance for growth and the price is justified, buy. But don't buy because they are big, tech and just made up 30% they lost before.

VOO Holdings:

AAPL - 6.96%

MSFT - 6.49%

Googl - 2.15%

INTC - 0.41%

AMZN - 3.19%

So you would be buying an ETF which holds all the stocks you would be buying.  What does that accomplish?  Answer: Nothing.

Nah. Realistically the censorship isn't going to actually drive many people away. It's really to make the perform more ad friendly. If they get serious about blocking ad blockers that will also be a nice boost to RPU and reduce costs a little bit. And YouTube premium is growing very fast.

One of the things that fascinates me is how such a behemoth of a company grew to that size without making anything. I have never owned a physical product made by google. They are far from market leaders in the enterprise sector (AWS, Azure, Salesforce) but yet their business productivity suite continue to chug along. I have never paid for youtube and haven't paid a dime for my gmail account that is old enough to apply for a driver's license. It boggles my mind how much money a search engine, user data collection and targeted ad revenue can balloon. Truly some peak consumerism sht.

People have said I'm crazy for this take, but what would google do in a recession? A real recession or even prolonged stagflation. The first thing that falls is the advertising industry. If you think about it Google doesn't produce or own much of anything that isn't completely codependent on advertising revenue. People I've had this thought experiment with are quick to say that google owns the biggest media content platform ever. They aren't wrong, that ship could drink a lot of water before it would ever sink, but that platform has been a cash cow only by the merciful teet of advertising dollars. Google no doubt must know this. I think their recent initiative in attempt to get in on the short video format space that no one wants and even more recent initiative to convert users with Adblockers on youtube to convert them in to premium subscribers could be a tell future projections on what was once reliable revenue streams might be slowing down. By no means do I think google would be doomed they are a lot more than just youtube, but from an investing standpoint I could never justify entering a position after the great slingshot of covid 19.

So instead of just buying something like VOO which is heavily exposed to cap weight beta, I tilt toward smaller companies, value (both small and large) and momentum (which has a totally different return profile).

I've heard for years how Google is ""too advertising dependent"" and maybe that's true now... But remember that this company used to have 90% of its revenue come from Ads, that number is like 76% now? It's not like Meta that has 98% of revenue from ads... Google has a lot of levers

First and foremost, at the consumer level we have a watered down version of utilizing current advancements in AI for our own musings through things like ChatGPT, Dall-E, etc.

I do not think that this is where the market is heading, but giving plebs like us a few new toys to mess with isn't creating any real harm.

Most big tech companies have what would be considered just a couple decades past a monopoly. The reason we don't hear much of startups in this space is they are literally just acquired and gobbled up by the big players in the space as soon as something innovative hits the market. Apple is acquiring companies at a rate of about 90 per annum, you can view Google's more recent acquisitions [on Wiki](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mergers_and_acquisitions_by_Alphabet) which details a severe market uptick in AI, analytics, and robotics.

Unless you are an ""insider"" you probably won't hear too much on these advancements, as big tech acquires most of these companies before they come to market for an end user.

If you want to look at what technologies AI is being used for, look no further than CIA funding. Palantir is a decent example of a CIA funded startup that is now publicly traded.

You can also look at a CIA finance arm's offerings [here](https://www.iqt.org/portfolio/). Occasionally looking at the startups there, a certain air of dystopian future can arise.

Big data, big analytics, and big surveillance are a despot's wet dream, and as more developing nations increase internet access for their populations, these tools will become even more pervasive.

Not all redundancies in big tech will come directly from AI, but automation of historically human jobs is certainly in the pipeline. One needs to look no further than their local supermarket in the western world to see machines fulfilling the past roles of cashiers. 

It is speculated that Microsoft is using individual user data to train it's [AI models](https://mspoweruser.com/personal-data-to-train-ai/) after a recent change in their privacy policy.

While we may not see the ramifications of these moves for a couple years, it's safe to assume that big tech wielding such an extensive collection of user data that can be parsed through AI models is going to be seriously fucking lucrative, likely at the expense of the general public.

If you want a glimpse of the dystopian promiseland envisioned by big tech and government, check out Henry Kissinger and former Google CEO Eric Schmidt's book ""The Age of AI.""

18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,He died in his office 4 iPhone generations ago. Nobody noticed until the new intern was fired for raising a concern the design hadn't changed for ages,3329
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,I love how they change the word retiring to leaving. Makes it sound much worse.,1872
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,I’d say he’s been coasting for a good while now,642
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,At least show how they flip back and forth between straight edges and curved edges lol.,564
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,Turns out he was phoning it in for years.,86
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,"You know what I hate?  When they change shit just to change it.  When you have something that works well, leave it the fuck alone unless you’re making a dramatic improvement.",349
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,This is why I still have my 12 pro max.,24
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,"Good riddance, hopefully who ever takes over designs away the god awful camera bump. I’d sacrifice a little weight for a flat back and extra battery. And with titanium they should be saving so much weight…",230
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,"Bro had the easiest job in the world. He could have retired 3 years ago and no one would have known.  The only significant change, the move to titanium, resulted in the weakest iPhone to date lmao",69
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,Seems he didn't do much for the last few years. Cost saving. Bam bam bam calls!,8
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,At least all the cases and screen protectors carry over.,73
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,Bullish.,17
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,Why would someone even care what their phone looks like. They’re all just floating screens now. Worrying about the fashion of your phone is gay.,109
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,"Ok, but why is every model is this picture a 14 Pro? 12 Pro has a much smaller camera cutout, 13 Pro has a more yellow flash, and 15 Pro has a smaller top left lens and thinner metal bezel around the outside. At least they edited the color to sort of match the blue offered on the 15 Pro.",36
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,Oh no! How are they gonna make the same thing over and over again,4

18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,Apple proves how ridiculously stupid consumers in general are. I've had the same samsung for 4 years and THEY come our with new designs almost every year with new hardware. Apple understands their customers are all materialistic sheep.,6

18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,"Good, I don't know why they thought it was a good idea to make the camera so far out in the back, now everytime i put my phone down it's resting on the camera 😭",1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,"And yet, I see iPhones everywhere. 

The product is so good that their customers don’t mind sticking with an old design.

18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,Imagine getting paid that much to change absolutely nothing.,1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,There’s still a better phones to be made;) for a small fee,1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,It's not just the iPhone.. you could also say the same about all of their other products since Steve Jobs passed away.,1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,Considering he doesn’t change much i  these products year over year… calls.,1

18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,Same phone minor upgrades,1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,Good,1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,"You know the pic is fake, right? I had all those phones. None of the same. They’re very easily distinguishable from each other.",1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,They are hiring the dude from EA Sports who somehow spits out the same FIFA and Madden games every year and still sells millions of units.,1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,"I'm pretty sure by design they mean the guy who designs the internals of the phone, not the actual physical aesthetic of the phone. Right?",1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,"So someone copied an iPhone 13 Pro ad to write numbers 12 to 15 on it to prove what?

I mean the camera is the only thing to distinct between those 4 models because it got bigger each time.",1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,Maybe the next individual will do something with titanium?,1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,I thought he manage to reduce the weight by 1 gram and it made with Titanium too.,1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,Looks like the same shit. Glad he’s gone.,1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,"I went from the 8 to the 14 pro max and that was actually a substantial increase. At this rate (unless Apple throttles), I’ll be waiting until the 19 for any substantial change",1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,Good imo - Apple have dropped the ball majorly on iPhone design. For example Samsung has flip phones and patented the hell out of it. That is the future and Apple can’t even catch up. God I hate apple from a shareholder perspective ![img](emote|t5_2th52|31225)![img](emote|t5_2th52|27421),1

Will always remind me of shit old oven stove tops",1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,My opinion. If they put out a new design chances are there will be glitches so puts. If they keep the same old design people are going to be bored so puts. To be honest I just don't like apple.😆,1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,Someone fell in love with their design,1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,Oh good we may finally have a phone that isn’t the same as before. Where’s the innovation?,1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,"Iphone design has got very similar to razor design. When you run out of ideas, just add another blade/camera. Iphone 20 is a must buy. Why though? IT HAS 13 FVCKING CAMERAS, THATS WHY!",1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,I don’t think people understand what a VP is.,1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,Thank the lord we get some innovation now,1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,Come on 16!,1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,Lol come on they’re similar but posting fake stuff is silly. The camera bump area is 100% not the same size across all 4 of these generations. This is just a promo shot of the same model.,1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,Yes the design didn’t change but the picture is bulshit too. The camera bump of the 12 pro was smaller than the 13 pro.,1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,"Love the design… personally, i chose the one with the 3 cameras because it looked better than the other ones",1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,Hey that’s not fair. My 11 Pro Max looks identical too,1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,"Finally, it can look different than the last.",1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,I probably said the same about the blackberry design lol but I don’t how they can improve the current design,1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,"Good it’s ugly. lol I want a round phone shaped like a makeup case and have it be only 3” in diameter but it can withstand falls up to 4,500 meters and be able to be used in no oxygen",1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,Because it look f%king perfect. It can be like this forever whats ya all problem 😂 It's not shitty Samsung or other chinese shiet,1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,They’ll have to find someone else who can draw a rectangle.,1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,"I mean, this happens with a lot of design for fairly new products. Look at skateboards and snowboards for instance. When they were first thought up, no one really knew what people’s capability or needs would be with them. This led to wildly different and specialized attempts at designs as people started to figure it out, and competing brands would look totally different with each new innovation slowly making their way into all of the different products. Then, you basically reach an equilibrium where it’s more or less been figured out and the form-factor is clear. We are basically there with smartphones currently. The biggest question on the horizon right now: is bendable OLED tech robust enough for years of rugged use, so as not to be a roadblock for more compact foldable phones (or will people want this).",1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,People catching on lol...fuck apple,1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,They gave up pretending to innovate. Just just sell people the same phone with a different number on it.,1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,We’re long past the point where a new phone model each year is warranted.,1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,And yet their stock is up 70% since that iPhone 12 release.,1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,quiet quitter,1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,"Those clowns who say “oh this phone is the same as last time”, know that you can’t improve perfection. Doing an interview with Apple right now and I can’t wait to join the best company in the world.",1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,Anyone who brings back round edges gets hired,1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,"I don’t think the design is a problem, it’s looks/feels nice. Each phone doesn’t need to be a major improvement or design change from the last, it’s just a newer version. I’d consider the iPhone 12 and 15 to be the same phone.",1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,Since iPhone plans each years design years prior he probably saw no light at the end of the tunnel,1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,If it aint broke dont fix it.,1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,Oh no! All that courageous innovating they've been doing will grind to a halt!,1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,Mustve been the easiest and most overpaid job he ever had - shouldve kept milking it.,1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,The design is actually ok to keep and just improve on the materials. There is something about familiarity and association. If I want radically different designs and gimmick I will go with Android.,1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,Got bored of doing the same design for 10 years maybe,1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,Lived in Asia 8y ago and all the phones looked like current iPhones.,1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,Mans been stealing a living,1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,Bro became a millionaire for sleeping,1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,"I like how on one side you have people saying, ""If it ain't broke don't change it!""

And the in the same breath, ""This sucks they haven't changed anything!""",1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,"based on your image, I'd say he left about 4 iPhone models ago. He definitely stopped updating the design and kept turning in the same spec and technical drawings",1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,Calls. He obviously didn't innovate much during his time at Apple.,1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,Quiet quitting in action!,1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,They should have retained the Apple Watch Ultra guy,1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,"Titanium, though...",1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,Free money for doing no work,1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,Why everyone craving new design? It’s an iPhone with 15 different versions. You bought it and still talk shit lol,1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,I have an 11 pro and don’t fill like I’m missing a thing from a 15,1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,Good maybe someone can come through with some innovation,1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,"Titanium sounds so titanic, but not for this kind of money. $500 phone at best.",1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,imagine judging something by its looks and not its specs or performance. You reburbs would still be in after school care,1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,Finally! Fuck these square ones!,1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,He has obviously been overemployed,1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,"That’s a great news, all I see is titanium being used in Apple phone, but how is it relevant in a phone?",1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,Still rocking my iphone 4. Replaced the battery like 3 times. Thanks but I'll 5 more years for a better product.,1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,"Jokes aside, Where do we go from here, Almost every phone is a rectangular glass slab now differentiated by its camera module design. Because its the peak, The next step is a foldable or some radical change, So I guess till we get the iPhone fold, We are stuck with this.",1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,why fix something that works,1

18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,"What, exactly, would you say you do here?",1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,Good they have contributed shit,1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,You guys talk about iPhone but the real travesty is the Apple Watch. Easily the worst UI/UX out of all the Apple product,1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,Finally a new design maybe a screen 📺 on the back of the phone ☎️ would be a good 👍.,1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,They have 26 Industrial Designers on that team.  I'm sure they'll find the right designer to continue making $1300 phones.,1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,"Not sure why people are so angry in this thread. If you don’t like Apple, fair, but why feel the need to come and actively bash something that doesn’t affect you? lol.",1

18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,This is what’s best about iPhones. Not much has changed in design but you regards kept buying it. So long AAPL as long as you keep regarding,1

18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,"I am still using my Iphone 8 plus. Three batteries changed at the Apple Store later, it is still working fine. Apple still kicks out safety updates for it. And I figure saved between $3000 to $4000 by not buying a new iPhone for the last few years, depending on which one I could have bought.   
 
Next fall, I might upgrade.",1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,An actual example of quiet quitting. Good for him.,1

18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,Why would you need to change some thing that’s perfect even though other great items stay with the same design for decades? Who came up with the idea that you have to whip up a new design every year?,1

18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,"I’m still pissed at them for being caught maliciously and with intention, shorting the battery life of every iPhone before iPhone 11 who still owned theirs as actor customers on a phone line. 
Apple was not only caught doing this in order to solicit more revenues and get newer versions of iPhone sold, but the judge 👩‍⚖️ hearing in on the case, forced apple to submit a plea of guilt and pay a few billion in fines. 

Then the media, being owned by nut job George Soros, only had the story in the news outlets for a few hours. Not even long enough for the public to scream FU over. 

That’s almost as bad as when Steve Jobs had comments come out about how nasty of a person he was to his own daughter and how he treated people inside Apple who were the actual engineers to his ideas.  Apple, should have tanked years ago from those stories alone. The man was a sociopath.",1

In general, option strategies are used as either volatility trades or in combination with other exposures as hedges. What’s the rationale behind buying short-dated flexibility? Why not just buy or sell the underlying? Any extrinsic you pay will decay away fairly rapidly that close to expiry. In essence, the big players selling you these instruments are just extracting value from the portion of the market made up by retail investors. Or am I missing something?",1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,I never understood why they only go with solids. They should release a phone that has a pattern of color on the back.,1

18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,One of the nost useless positions in apple 🤣,1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,judging by how much (or rather little) the products change from generation to generation  no one will notice his departure for quite some time,1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,"There’s so much potential here for their design development:
 
- Remove the camera bumps

- Actually give the option for an SD card

- similar to androids, re introduce the option for a fingerprint scanner as part of the volume rocker or a side finger print scanner (I miss having the option)

- a headphone jack. It’s ridiculous, it’s 2023 and I have to use adaptors for everything to dual charge (listen to music while charging my phone in the car) amongst other silly inconveniences. It’s wild to me that the general public - mostly in USA I find - will defend it also. “Oh well everything is Bluetooth just get a Bluetooth” the fact is when that fails and always does, the option for hardwired connection is always preferred. It’s very cheap to add a headphone jack and phones muchhhh cheaper than an iPhone today have one. 

The list goes on. But I need to keep my android tucked away because people complain too much about creating group chats and not being about to iMessage you if you’re not in the IOS community. The one and only reason I still have an iPhone is iMessage but it’s growing old. The convenience is nice of having an iPhone, but I prefer having an Android as my daily device. iPhone just makes it easier for me to communicate with family who live abroad and where I live the networks are terrible, wifi communication has saved us with iMessage. Especially for people who don’t have Facebook or won’t use what’sapp, I’ve always appreciated imessage as a service. I wish it was an app available for use on Android. 

I miss having my android and the flexibility. I miss the battery life, even on $100-$200 android phones is better than an iPhone. I’m getting very tired of throwing away money on a new battery that dies out way too quickly and/or new hardware every couple of years I really don’t need but am forced into because the old devices start working less performance and battery wise. The devices are so expensive and don’t even have a headphone jack. 

It’s criminal at this point and beyond the iPhone 13, I don’t see myself getting a new iPhone not even the 15 any time soon. I’m upset they are also introducing ESIM beyond the 14 models. I’m okay with having a SIM card.",1

I just know how much a battery is going to deteriorate from normal use over the course of 4-6 years… and I know the ONLY real selling point year after year is the slightly improved battery life. Also.. you know, it has a brand new battery in it. 

So again, either you’re full of shit, blatantly being deceptive/omitting info, OR… you should see if your “newer” iPhone falls under some warranty/policy from wherever you got it from… cuz something’s wrong with the battery.

So you’re retired if you change your job at all? That’s not what a “retiree” is. Generally, when one is retired, they have chosen to stop working for the most part. Could happen young for those that achieved a high level of wealth early in life. 

Saying you “retired from a pro hockey career” is a more specific use of the term, and whether they are retired in general is another question.",1

18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,His example of the military means when someone puts in 20+ years of work they are eligible for a pension that they will receive for the rest of their life.

18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,"Show me where I said that. Cool. Thanks. This isn't a difficult concept, not sure why I wasted my time. 

When did I say you're retired if you change your job? What are you even reading? You even answered your own misconception. A retiree is someone who has retired from a job or profession OR stops working entirely. So a retired pro hockey player would be a retiree even if they grabbed an announcing gig. How is this so hard to understand?",-10
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,"I never said they can’t work anymore. 

Here’s the definition: “a person who has retired from a working or professional career” (https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/retiree)

There’s a difference between saying you’re retired/a retiree and saying you’re retired from x career (even if you have a pension.)

Your status, if you still work a significant amount of time, is not “a retiree” on a census form or similar things. Even if you receive a pension.",1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,"You seemed to be suggested if someone retires from the military and chooses to take on another/different job after, however that person isn’t retired (like if there was a census, they wouldn’t state that they are a retiree). I was explaining that there’s a difference between saying you’re retired from a specific career vs being retired in general. I thought that was pretty clear. The term can be used in different ways - just as saying “I’m retiring to bed” also doesn’t mean you’re retired from the working world in general. 

Literally no one said expired lol
