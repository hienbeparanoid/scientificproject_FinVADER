18hzuzp,Opinions?,"First of all congratulations on starting early.  You will thank yourself. Good job.  Second at your age if you just concentrate on broad ETFs that is the best path for most.  You will hear this over and over. If it were me I would just invest the $5 per day in VTI, VOO or VT.  SPY is very good but the others i mentioned have lower expenses.  I don’t think you need any JEPY at your age. The rest of these companies may well turn a profit but you have time on your.  $100 per month in one of the ETFs above will work wonders with compound growth.  If you want a little more tech exposure you could look at QQQM in addition or VXUS for international. It boring investing that way but it works.  I would check out r/bogleheads if you are interested in this way of investing.  Just my 2 cents but you will probably hear the same here.  Good luck.",11
18hzuzp,Opinions?,Put it all in VOO and you’ll be good,3

18hzuzp,Opinions?,"Don't know if I would stay in LCID much longer , their outlook isn't very good if what I read somewhere is the case.(low on cash it seems)

Although a lot of people are skeptical of Chinese stocks , I would seriously consider getting Nio if you are into EV stocks, IF you can get it for 7€ or less per stock.

This is if you aren't looking to hold for a long time though, but as of now you can probably squeeze out a solid 10 to 20% profit in the near term with relative certainty with the current price point of the stock. ( Sentiment on Nio is very mixed at the moment , but hopefully ""Nio days"" at the end of the month can change that to be more positive)

Don't take my word for it tho, as stocks are a finicky thing and I'm most certainly no professional.",0

18hzuzp,Opinions?,"Are you investing , looking for income , or just throwing money into anything ? What direction are y you looking for ?",1
18hzuzp,Opinions?,do you think I divid that 100 into 4 different ETFs and it would be better? Or should I stick to a single one?,2
18hzuzp,Opinions?,I have one of the _yld funds.  I'm hoping to sell at my break even point.  My question is why is their so much hype around these funds?  It's sounds interesting but I'm not buying anymore.  Remember nusi?  So much love for these funds and I'm not sure why.,1
18hzuzp,Opinions?,I will! I had a lot of suspicions on it cause it seemed a lil too good too be true!,1
18hzuzp,Opinions?,"I took a 16 hour SIE class and we went over options, I dabbled a little bit and I lost a pretty penny (50$ dollars) but I see the crazy profits that can emerge from them.",3
18hzuzp,Opinions?,"If it were me and I knew what I know now at your age I would put all $100 per month in VTI or VOO.  These are very diversified funds.  There are over 3,700 stocks in VTI alone.  I put the link below for the top 50 holdings.  I think it is a better strategy than what you have above but I am just 1 person. I am 49 and I can tell you this strategy has worked well for me and I will be able to retire early. Once I got a solid base in a broad based fund (FXAIX in my 401k, equivalent of VOO) I branched out a little to include VXUS, QQQM and BND.   I don’t think you need bonds at your age.  
Like I said SPY is also a great choice but has a little higher fees.  
Just remember investing at your age you can’t do much wrong by picking good individual companies but I believe a broad ETF is the ticket.  I would build a solid base in 1 and then branch out as you age.  Just 1 man’s opinion.  I wish you luck. 

https://stockanalysis.com/etf/vti/holdings/",1
18hzuzp,Opinions?,"I would say you should choose a combination of VOO (big caps), QQQ (tech heavy, overvalued), VNQ (real estate, significantly undervalued but benefit the most when interest rate drops next year), XLF (finance), XLE (energy, high dividend, good for diversified), XLI (industrial), BIL (short-term government bond, no risk, 5.2% annual return guaranteed). 

Basically, instead of choosing individual stocks, you should invest sector ETFs that you believe will benefit the most given the macroeconomic conditions. Given interest rate will drop next year, tech and real estate will benefit the most. But tech sector is already priced in to some extent, so real estate is the best place to invest. 

Ideal portfolio: 50% QQQ, 50% VNQ

18hzuzp,Opinions?,Do NOT listen to this. A lot more people lose money buying options than those that make money. Stick with index funds as others have mentioned. Do NOT take any advice from WSB. In fact don’t even read that unless you just want to laugh at comments. 1/2 of it is fake and the other 1/2 is idiots. And I would recommend dumping CGC and taking the tax break. It’s never going to be a winner.,2

Could it match Tesla? That's a pipe dream. Could it replicate 1/5th of Tesla's success and still be one of the best opportunities out there currently? Still unlikely, but at least plausible. 


I used to sell covered calls on my shares. I think the potential for sudden growth is better than the meager premiums collected. I remain neutral to slightly bullish if for no other reason than there seems to be more upside potential than downside risk left. It would be too much an embarrassment for the National Party to let NIO fail, and it isn't like there is much else in China that seems particularly attractive for growth investors currently.",4

So yes, in China they will put more EVs into the market, but they still are not even close to matching Tesla's profits in China.

So you are saying every job, regardless of skill level, should provide a wage high enough to afford a 'decent living' even in high-cost areas?. Let's take a hypothetical scenario: if a cashier at your local grocery store or a barista at Starbucks were to earn $30/hour, how do you think that would impact the cost of goods and services? Higher wages in these roles would likely lead to increased costs for consumers. 

People in fields like engineering, medicine, and finance earn higher wages in NYC, often in line with their specialized skills and training. In contrast, service sector jobs, which might have provided decent pay in the economy of the 70s and 80s, now face a different economic reality. Today's economy is more tech-driven, and the value placed on specialized skills has increased accordingly. 

The reality is, if a job requires only a short training period, say two weeks, this often implies a higher potential for employee turnover and replaceability. This factor is a significant consideration in wage determination. we need to be realistic about the economic impact and sustainability of significantly higher wages for entry-level, low-skill positions in the current tech driven economy.",4

My contention is that we shouldn't structure our society such that vast quantities of people have to live on the margins.

Some ways to accomplish this include putting caps on the ratio of CEO:worker pay, taxing large companies for the money their employees use on government assistance, expanding public services overall, forcing companies to engage in greater profit sharing, etc.

These companies are making massive profits. Starbucks has an operating margin of [16%](https://investor.starbucks.com/press-releases/financial-releases/press-release-details/2023/Starbucks-Reports-Q4-and-Full-Year-Fiscal-2023-Results/default.aspx).

These companies aren’t just going to take the margin hit like that, they’re just not….and prices are going up by a lot to compensate all the way down the supply chain. Starbucks isn’t just going to sit back and be like “Wellp, guess we’re just gonna have to pay everyone 30$/hour and cut our margins to a 3rd of what they used to be.”. Then what about that nurse who was making 30$/ hour seeing these 18-20 year old kids making the same money they do with 0 skills and 0 college education? They’re going to demand higher wages now too or else why even be a nurse anymore and deal with that stress? Just go work at a McDonald’s or Starbucks or Chipotle and get your 30$ an hour. The inflationary effects of doubling entry level job wages like that would do more harm than good to the overall economy.

DE is a good long term hold.
CMI could have issues over the long term as all engines very gradually move to electric, but we’re talking decades, and it’s well managed. They’ve seen cycle after cycle.
You can do better than large US banks, so while I’m not super negative in the short term about banks, and WFC will see a nice bounce as rates come in, that’s something that could be harvested for another company with better long term growth prospects.

17vbl8a,"Opinions on Pfizer, JNJ, Cummins, Wells Fargo, Deere, PPG","Depending on the size of the portfolio, it's almost certain you should consult a tax professional about this.  

The former owner's goals and circumstances will likely be different than yours.  

I strongly believe that if someone is going to own individual stocks, they should be doing so actively and should be commiting time each week and even each day on that.  Otherwise, you can pay someone to manage it for you.  

Being newly retired (?) your priorities might be around tax optimization and stable income and capital preservation but still needing some growth.   

The names you're soliciting, here is some common sentiment on them.  I don't endorse or reject it, I just relay it.

PFE has been deemed a loser in the suffering sector of big pharma.  The speculation now is that maybe it is getting to be so bad it's good.  

JNJ has assymetric risk from ongoing litigation.  Rightly or wrongly, they're going through a tumbler of expensive litigation and settlements.  Maybe they can beat some of it and emerge.  But the thesis would be why take that bumpy ride with them if there are hundreds of other stocks that are good and don't have that form of risk.

Cummins has been battered of late but is kind of best of breed of what they do.  If one believes that infrastructure and building and global recovery are imminent, then Cummins will prosper from that.  

Deere is seen as agriculture and infrastructure/construction.  Agriculture has been battered too, and Deere, being one that rode very high, has been getting taken back down.  Similar concepts as with Cummins, if one believes in things happening through 2024 that benefit heavy industry, that can help Deere.  However Deere is exposed to the ups and downs of Ag.  

Notice that you have some overlaps with PFE/JNJ and DE/CMI.  

Wells Fargo is considered one of the weak sisters of banking along with C Citigroup.  Sometimes you can gamble on these more-disliked plays whe they rebound from ""hated"" to merely ""despised"".  If doing that, you'd want that to be a conscious strategy though.  But again, not best of breed here.",3

JNJ - a stronger hold than PFE. Actually a growing company too.  
  
CMI - idk much about it but it seems to be a strong, growing company. I would hold.  
  
WFC - I wouldn’t sell unless you have a specific preferred place to put the money. Price to book is below 1 which implies its at a cheap price but that does depend on some things.    
  
DE - should be a strong performer but idk much in specifics  
  
PPG - should also be a strong performer

If you could rent out your house for $3,000 a month, then paying $1 for it on the market would be an unbelievable opportunity.

17m3pf5,Opinion: Alternative Investments will Prevent a Stock Crash,"I did engage with a point in the actual article. He values google at 0.  Only dividend stocks have value to him.  This is idiotic.  Owning 1 share of Merck gets you a dividend.  According to his valuation metric, that 1 share of Merck is worth more than 100% ownership of google.  Anyone who would trade 100% of google for 1 share of Merck is, unequivocally, not a good investor.  This does not require further explanation. Nevertheless, I will briefly explain some small portion of the sheer idiocy of this article.

1. The author defines an investor as only being someone who would buy something even if they were unable to ever sell it.  This is a terrible definition.  It in no way aligns with the purposes of investing. 

2. He argues that dividends are the only purpose of stocks.  This is narrowminded, and factually incorrect.  Dividends are one feature of some stocks.  The purpose of stocks is to enable fractional ownership interests of an enterprise, and the purchase and sale of such fractional ownership interests. For most investors, the purpose of investing is to generate a positive return on your investment, whatever form that takes. Admittedly, some investors choose stocks for reasons other than pecuniary gain, but that is an idea that I personally believe is inherently silly.

3. He seems to think most people would buy a house they could never sell, ostensibly without discounting the price of it, and that the willingness of someone to pay more later is irrelevant to price.  This is inherently stupid.  (One reason is that it would permanently tie you to one location, which for a great many people is a non-starter.)  When you buy a T-Bill or a savings bond, you are not buying a steady income stream. You are buying a promise from the government to pay more to get it back at a later date.  The entire value is in the increased payment on surrender of the instrument.  That does not make it something other than an investment.

4.  By the author's definition, Berkshire Hathaway is worthless, and Warren Buffet is, ostensibly, poor, because Berkshire Hathaway does not produce a dividend.  This is silly.  While Berkshire Hathaway does not pay a dividend, it does own a great many shares in dividend aristocrat stocks, and by owning an interest in that, you essentially own a fractional interest in those holdings. Putting them inside a holding company does not, in fact, render them worthless.

5. The author claims that you can predict the future price of a company by some combination of its dividends and its dividend growth rates, and states that he requires dividends as proof of value.  Dividends are terrible proof of value.  That is not what they are for.  In fact, there have been a great many companies to offer growing dividends right up to the point where they take a turn and result in bankruptcy, losing you your principle.  Additionally, it is worth pointing out that per his analysis, companies that don't produce dividends in fact do continue to trade above $0, which means you cannot predict their price by his metric.

6.  If only things that generate an income stream have value, then a briefcase full of cash is worthless. A briefcase full of gold is worthless. A tanker full of oil is worthless.  

7. I once had a friend tell me that gold was worth so much more than cash, that he'd pay $2,000 in cash for $1,000 worth of gold. I told him I had $1,000 worth of gold, and would gladly sell it to him for $2,000, with which I would then buy twice that much gold, and I'd be willing to do that transaction as many times as he wanted.  He instantly realized his error and declined to move forward with the deal.  Anyone who claims that buying something because you believe someone will pay more for it later is not investing, is not an investor.

8. After pages of rambling discourse including such gems as calling dividends the purpose of stocks, valuing all non-dividend companies at 0, and stating that companies future price can be established by looking at dividend and dividend growth alone, he has the audacity to claim he is not a dividend investor.  This is ludicrous.

9. The author values google at 0, because it does not produce a dividend.  If that does not cause you to label him an idiot and view everything else he says with extreme skepticism, you might be ""hard of thinking.""

10. As per my quote above, anyone who reads this article and buys into it will be dumber for having read it.  Unless they're incredibly lucky, they'll also be poorer for it.

I am not claiming dividends are worthless. Some of my portfolio is in stocks that produce dividends.  Dividends are, however, a piece of the picture and not the picture itself.  If I could have the Hope Diamond, the Mona Lisa, and all the gold in Fort Knox somewhere producing 0 income, I'd trade my entire portfolio for them... then I'd liquidate them, because I could, because they have value that is not tied to any periodic revenue stream that they create.",3

>They tend to outperform the market over time

""Over time""? To make a statement like that, you have to provide several decades worth of data. Come back to us in 40 years and then tell us whether or not they outperform the market over time.",-2
17m3pf5,Opinion: Alternative Investments will Prevent a Stock Crash,I'd say its pretty high chance given unemployment at 3 something % and we just came off of a 9% inflation peak. You can't be saying there isn't enough demand... you'd disagree with the fed too.,1
17m3pf5,Opinion: Alternative Investments will Prevent a Stock Crash,"This is one of the reasons why the rich get richer, and the poor get poorer. In a crash situation when everyone is losing their job, it's only those with disposable cash that can afford to buy assets at rock bottom prices.

For example, before 2008, private equity hardly ever invested in residential real estate. It was too ""bitty"". But in 2008 during the housing crash. At that time, companies like Blackstone were the only ones able to raise vast amounts of capital at rock-bottom interest rates that were unavailable to ordinary people for precisely the reasons that you pointed out - namely that they had lost their job and were foreclosing.

Blackstone generated obscene profits during that time.

Moral of the story: A crash can be very profitable if you're in a position to do so. In fact, I have no doubt that right now, there are a bunch of people getting down on their knees and praying to Jesus for a crash.",0
17m3pf5,Opinion: Alternative Investments will Prevent a Stock Crash,"I can address many of your objections by asking one simple question:

""Is Bitcoin an investment?""

Based on your answer, we can proceed to understand what you consider to be ""value"". Is it merely the price someone is willing to pay for an object, or is it something intrinsic to the object regardless of price?

>The purpose of stocks is to enable fractional ownership interests of an enterprise, and the purchase and sale of such fractional ownership interests.

As the article explains, this is not true.

>For most investors, the purpose of investing is to generate a positive return on your investment, whatever form that takes.

Again, Bitcoin has fantastic returns according to this definition.

>When you buy a T-Bill or a savings bond, you are not buying a steady income stream. You are buying a promise from the government to pay more to get it back at a later date. The entire value is in the increased payment on surrender of the instrument. That does not make it something other than an investment.

It's still a forced income stream. The bond will mature and you will be forced to accept whatever payments it generates as long as you hold it. Even with a zero coupon bond, you'll be forced to receive the income.

>there have been a great many companies to offer growing dividends right up to the point where they take a turn and result in bankruptcy, losing you your principle

Individual examples aren't persuasive. There are many non-dividend companies that are terrible investments as well. The claim is not that dividends are proof of value by themselves. There is a difference between a condition being necessary and the condition being sufficient.

>If only things that generate an income stream have value, then a briefcase full of cash is worthless. A briefcase full of gold is worthless. A tanker full of oil is worthless.

And a wallet full of Bitcoin?

>Anyone who claims that buying something because you believe someone will pay more for it later is not investing, is not an investor.

By this definition, Warren Buffett is not an investor. He said recently that he wouldn't pay $25 for all the Bitcoin in the world.

>then I'd liquidate them, because I could, because they have value that is not tied to any periodic revenue stream that they create.

You would liquidate them because you would be eager to unload useless objects on the first fool that comes along. And then use the money to invest in an income stream (hopefully).",1

17m3pf5,Opinion: Alternative Investments will Prevent a Stock Crash,"back to the main point, I would argue though that once private equity gets marked to market, a crash in PE will cause devastating losses in all asset classes. It would make a stock crash even worse. A global margin call in one asset class is rarely isolated to just that, and the worse it is, the worse everything else gets. I think you have a good understanding of things but your conclusion is backwards.",1
17m3pf5,Opinion: Alternative Investments will Prevent a Stock Crash,"Liquidating all the gold in Fort Knox, the Mona Lisa, and the Hope diamond by selling them to the first fool to come along is lunacy.  First of all, I'd want to wait to liquidate the bulk of this until I was paying only long term capital gains tax.  Second I'd want to extract top dollar, and not just sell to the first person willing to buy.  Third, these are not useless objects.  Fourth, the fact that you think someone willing to pay a price for all the gold in fort knox, the hope diamond, and the mona lisa, is an ""idiot"" tells me that this discussion is pointless.   As such, I am done with it.  Please, invest according to your thought processes as described herein.  As Charlie Munger once said, ""If other people weren't wrong so often, we wouldn't be nearly as rich as we are.""",1
17m3pf5,Opinion: Alternative Investments will Prevent a Stock Crash,">that once private equity gets marked to market

I think that ship has sailed. If anything, it appears that more and more of the companies are going private. In the past 20 years, the number of companies going public has dropped in half compared to the 20-year period before that.

In 1996, there were ~8000 firms on the US stock market. Today there are lesser than 4000.

18difix,Why NIO Inc is Undervalued,"You clearly don’t understand *why* people would buy a battery swap enabled car. Most things with humans is not logical. It’s emotional. 

Most of us here are dudes, just by the statistics of stock trading. So most of us don’t have any problems emotionally or physically handling fast charging cables. But if you are a tiny little woman, and you see yourself as feminine emotionally, wielding big, rigid, heavy and sometimes dirty charging cables is not what you want to do. What about battery swap? You sit in your car and it does it fully automatically in 4 minutes.

As anybody here knows who have a relationship with a woman, you know that just because they can do something, doesn’t mean that they won’t pay to not do that thing even though it makes absolutely no logical sense.

And then there is the other aspect: Time. Where would your woman like to be? At the supercharger for 30 minutes, or at home 30 minutes earlier? And with the kids in the back asking “when can we be home??” what does your woman think of that? I think she thinks “it would sure be nice if the kids could be home at the house instead sitting here”.

Why is the blue bubble on iPhones a thing that you’d pay $800 more for?
Why does girls who care NADA about technology need the newest iPhone 15 Pro Max 256GB?
Why did the sale of Model Y literally explode once some women saw other women in families buy it?

Buying a product is an emotional decision. These are cars made for families, and who signs off on the big purchase decisions in *most* families?

But here’s the problem: Your woman need to have experienced the supercharger cable situation. The 30-60 minute charge session. And then she needs to know about or experience the battery swap. And THATS Nio’s biggest problem at this point (IMO).

Hell they can probably be restocked by fleets of robots driving self driving cars too.  The entire energy distribution backbone is touch free and fully automated.

Walmart entered the German market in 1997 with the acquisition of the Wertkauf and Interspar hypermarket chains. However, Walmart’s German stores struggled because its business model wasn’t working there. Walmart wanted to follow the below-cost strategy, but the German business owners didn’t like Walmart’s low-cost pricing tactic as well as the German government. As a result, the American giant was ordered to raise its prices by the German high court which became an obstacle for it to having a customer base. Walmart and German unions were incompatible. In Germany, unlike in the US, unions are very much a part of the culture and have broad support amongst the government, the community, and even businesses. Walmart didn’t understand that in Germany, companies and unions are closely connected. Also, The German workforce is accustomed to negotiating their pay with their union. This caused friction between the workers and the company. When Walmart refused to join Germany’s regional wage bargaining system, the worker’s union went on strike. Walmart was taken aback for this reason. This also gave them a bad reputation in the community and likely affected their sales.",18

“First, government incentives have made EVs the best financial choice for consumers. Norwegians who buy all-electric vehicles do not have to pay high value-added taxes or registration taxes and receive other financial benefits as well.”


“Second, the government has invested heavily in EV chargers and as a result Norway has the most public fast chargers per capita of any country in the world. These can get an EV battery from zero to 80% in as little as 20 minutes. In addition, Norway has established a right to charge for people living in apartment buildings and provides grants for housing associations to install their own chargers.

Third, Norway has also provided EV owners with some attractive perks, such as free parking in cities, exemptions or reductions in road tolls, access to priority bus lanes and reduced rates for EVs to be transported by ferry (ferries are frequently used given Norway’s fjord-covered landscape).

18ch3n7,Danish pension funds (43 billion USD) starts selling TSLA stocks due to labor union dispute,"You do not understand how collective agreements work - this is like saying that supporting the [minimum wage of 10.42£ in the UK](https://www.acas.org.uk/national-minimum-wage-entitlement) means that you want every person in the UK to earn 10.42£.

In Sweden we have no minimum wage - 90% of our companies are part of these collective agreements with the union.[It's not only about salaries - it's about insurance, pensions, salary increases and fairness.](https://www.beyondo.se/news/collective-agreements-in-sweden)

Technology & Options do not solve worker rights. They are not ""getting pension funds and governments involved"" - our government is very much NOT allowed to get involved even if they have tried to get the unions to stop. Our unions are very sympathetic and work together. This is why the postal workers, harbour workers and unions in Norway and Denmark have started to ""sympathize strike"" against Tesla.

IF is not losing - they are just following procedure with the rest of the unions when ""rock star CEOs"" try to ignore our ruleset. [According to the numbers they have 10 billion SEK in their battle chest which is enough to keep the strike going for 500 years.](https://omni.se/if-metall-star-redo-med-10-miljarder-i-strejkkassan/a/veBVxL)

Companies have tried this before - [Toys R US had to give up and form a special case for Sweden with their ""no union policy""](https://www.huffpost.com/archive/ca/entry/what-canada-can-learn-from-swedens-unionized-retail-workers_n_6888328) and[Amazon had to change to a third-hand-party with collective agreement because you can't fight the unions here](https://www.politico.eu/article/amazons-cut-price-culture-meets-swedens-unions/). The reason the unions are fighting hard is because that's why they exist. To force companies to fall in line to Swedish worker demands.

[Sweden is among the most unionized countries in the world](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1356735/labor-unions-most-unionized-countries-worldwide/) with 65.7% of the workforce unionized. You can't just ignore that if you want to last here.  


Edit:    
\> *IF is fighting hard and it’s definitely not going their way, otherwise  they wouldn’t have to get pension funds and governments involved.*   


This is the dumbest argument. It's like saying *""the US is fighting Japan hard and it's definitely not going their way, otherwise they wouldn't have to get nuclear bombs or ships involved.""*

Stuff like the pension funds and getting other countries Unions involved are powerful weapons that make the fight go IF's way.",10
18ch3n7,Danish pension funds (43 billion USD) starts selling TSLA stocks due to labor union dispute,"I mean that's just how entry level salaries work. And from my understanding new car mechanics with no experience on their first job all make more than 23 000 due to the high demand for them so it's not surprising in the least that Tesla has higher entry level salaries than what the CBA requires. Everyone else does too. The 23 000 SEK is a floor for newbies the times when there isn't a high demand.

I mean do you \_really\_ believe that all the other mechanics at BMW, Volvo, Ford etc only make 23 000? Of course you don't, that would be stupid.

And if it was only about salaries there probably wouldn't be a strike. The CBA is about pensions, insurances, overtime payments and yearly raises to name a few areas where Tesla has fallen short according to employees on strike,",1

If you followed the story of reusable rockets, you'd understand that Shuttle and Falcon 9 are radically different designs. Comparing them the way you have done here - extrapolating the failures of Shuttle to Falcon 9 - can only be described as disingenuous.

You have spun a narrative here, that is fair to say. I'm sure some of those unfamiliar with the subject will find it quite convincing.",6

18ch3n7,Danish pension funds (43 billion USD) starts selling TSLA stocks due to labor union dispute,"What are you smoking the Falcon 9 is the cheapest per kg launch by a long shot with the soyuz-2 coming in second with like 30% the efficiency. Ignoring the fact that the USA would like to pay a premium to not be tied to a Russian system. Sure not every launch needs that capacity, but even if it's only at 1/4 load it's still competitive, and probably still the most reliable.  


Your numbers are also a bit wonky. So fuel in rockets is the cheap part of them compared to everything else, and weight of payload is far more the limiting factor for fuel usage than reuse. So yeah reusing the rocket cuts the amount of payload it can carry, however the falcon 9 can carry way more than all but the ULAs Atlas V, in it's weight group. And the Atlas V costs over 40million more to launch currently. The ones even bigger than that cost astronomical amounts and are rarely used. Which the Falcon 9 heavy crushes in both max weight liftable and expected cost.",1

""Musk is a genius at marketing""

""Almost every news outlet, every YT channel, every auto review..."" is talking about Elon and Tesla. Check out Google Trends. Not just the Cybertruck. This whole ""antisemitism accusations"" ordeal. Every time the media shits on X or Elon you're increasing his power.

The amount of news coverage Tesla is going to get from this event for free is the the genius at marketing. Tesla and Elon being hated generates clicks. You click on the articles. You talk about it on social media. People know his name and products because you go around complaining about them.

The media associate Tesla and Elon articles with clicks. You guys are a bunch of trained monkeys working for Musk and you don't even realize it.
