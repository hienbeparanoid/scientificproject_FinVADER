17s8uuv,Microsoft $MSFT at all time high!,It's unchristian.,2
17s8uuv,Microsoft $MSFT at all time high!,"Sure. I realize everyone's valuation models are a little different.

I have a couple ways of doing it, but the simplest to explain for filtering supremely overvalued stocks is this. I basically ask the question: could this company deliver more distributable cashflow to me as a shareholder over the next 10 years than a bond of similar safety.

So, let's say we're looking at MSFT. I would compare to 10+ year A-rated corporate bonds (roughly 5.5% right now) or Treasury bonds (4.6% right now). I take 75% of MSFT earnings yield (no company can distribute 100% of earnings yield, and even 75% is very high that would pretty much eliminate growth), and then I check to see what type of annual earnings growth would have to be achieved in order for my equity portfolio to equal the portfolio growth of the bond portfolio. Right now, MSFT has an earnings yield of 2.8%. So, starting year one as though we were actually getting 75% of this (2.1%), I then see how much annual growth we would have to achieve to equal roughly 5.5% from bonds. In this particular example, we would need 20% growth annualized over 10 years for our MSFT account to equal A-rated corporate bonds. 15% growth would equal a bond portfolio of roughly 4.3% over the next 10 years.

The interpretation is this: MSFT would have to distribute 75% of their earnings as dividends (they presently distribute 25%) AND grow their earnings at 20% per year in order for us to receive the same cashflow as A-rated corporate bonds over the next 10 years. If we add in the fact that MSFT stock could lose valuation, whereby those holding the stock could have capital losses, I just don't see the bullish argument in support of MSFT stock right now.

I have several other techniques to value a company, but the conclusion is the same. MSFT would need sustained high growth and no multiple contraction for the stock to be worth it at the present valuation.",2

Just because you know the general idea of how it works doesn't mean it cannot ""think"". We also know how human brain works generally, by communicating across neurons with chemicals. But you do not say ""therefore it cannot really understand or think"".

The large foundational models are displaying very unexpected emergent abilities, which, we actually do not fully understand.

Coming to maths, can you do simple arithmetic accurately and fast like your calculator? No because neural networks aren't very good at that. The foundational models are emulating your thinking structure, not a calculator's. You (or someone in your species) on the other hand can carry or abstract thinking to formulate or propagate advanced math, connect it to real life, etc. which Wolfram Alpha cannot do - nor any classical software can. Large models on the other hand do these kind of things surprisingly well.

No one is feigning competence at anything.  Nigel is competent at scrabble, which is why he is able to win at scrabble. The 'fundamental understanding' you're asking for is simply a different task from the one he's completing.  


>the same way chess moves have been discussed as nauseum

But what makes a good move is highly dependent on the precise configuration of pieces.  General principles of chess break down far before .  the level of play that ChatGPT is able to achieve.  It's not simply applying the basic rules it knows from reading about them, it is taking multiple conflicting chess principles and somehow intelligently picking the most salient ones \*for that unique position.\*  This is a very hard and impressive task for something that hasn't been trained to do so.

>ChatGPT can't play chess

If it can't play chess, then how come it can play chess so well?  If a robot were  to 'outrun' a human, would you say ""it can't run, because to run is to have awareness that you are a human putting one foot in front of another etc. etc. but no this machine simply executes a series of mechanical movements that it doesn't \*really\* understand in order to do the some motions and cross the finish line before the human so it's not \*really\* running"".  I'm not so interested in that.... it can play chess because it plays chess.",3

You're demonstrating some very fundamental misunderstanding about what a LLM actually is. 

A LLM is not a general AI, it is not even a ""baby-general AI"". 

Imagine the Library of Babel that has every imaginable combination of English alphabets in its system, it has Macbeth in it and poems not yet written but you wouldn't say the Library has written literature. ChatGPT can say the words that makes it sound like it understand because of a combination of supervised learning and RLHF. 

A chess engine actually uses search and evaluate functions and has endgame tables to process and evaluate moves as it develops. A LLM doesn't do that, it just process...okay I'm just repeating myself at this point. Arguing that more is like arguing with someone who thinks a car moves because there are little horses in the front instead of the internal combustion that takes place. I should just delete this but I've written so much already. Take it, read it, debate it, I don't care anymore.",2
17s8uuv,Microsoft $MSFT at all time high!,"When and where did I say ""you said all Microsoft products will be outdated in top level comment not just windows""? Don't make things up. You asked me about windows and I answered and then you asked me why I focused on windows? You like to go round in circles, huh? You are probably right that windows based (Apple influenced) products are not going away for the next two decades but for an operating system that is used by the masses, I prefer Apple over microsoft or android. I wouldn't be surprised if AI develops a better operating system then we currently have.  Go buy microsoft if that makes you happy.",1
17s8uuv,Microsoft $MSFT at all time high!,"I have enough humility and curiosity to consider that I might be wrong, unlike you, but I'm also competent enough at reasoning and informed enough on this subject (as a software engineer and chess player) to see that your analogies are poor, most of your statements are beside the point, and your entire argument is to basically beg the question with the word 'fake' and then pretend like this isn't just semantics/philosophy.  


>using language to persuade people it understand something

No. It's using \*good chess moves\* to demonstrate this.  If it beat the world champion you'd be all 'nah it's just tricking you! It's actually really bad at chess!"" Or maybe you just don't understand the difficulty of playing as well as it currently is.  


>A LLM is not a general AI, it is not even a ""baby-general AI"".

It's sure a good thing that I never said otherwise and this has nothing to do with the question at hand.  


>it has Macbeth in it and poems not yet written but you wouldn't say the Library has written literature

Another completely off the mark analogy. This is like saying ChatGPT plays 1 trillion chess games, some of which are good, means it's good at chess.  Of course that's nonsense but that's also absolutely not what's happening.  


>A chess engine actually uses search and evaluate functions and has endgame tables to process and evaluate moves as it develops. A LLM doesn't do that

I love how you consider search and evaluation functions to be authentic understanding unlike 'fake' understanding of LLM.  So if ChatGPT coded some search and evaluation functions and used them to play chess, then suddenly it wouldn't be faking it anymore?  There's philosophical point about knowledge to be made somewhere in there, but you sure aren't making it.",2
17s8uuv,Microsoft $MSFT at all time high!,But what's your point? If it walks like a duck and talks like a duck then it's a duck. Do we even know what general AI looks like and if it's attainable?
