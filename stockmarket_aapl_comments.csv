17sz3xi,Trying to understand this chart. Massive AAPL buy at 4 PM. But prices don't seem to synch with chart. 1. What was the actual closing price? 2. Why would a trading algorithm continue to buy at increasing higher prices? 3. How could you have played that trade? Is it even possible to get in? . :-),"Looks fine to me. The large institutional investors that use Apex Clearing House as their trade desk have designated windows for trading of their mutual funds and index funds to reflect inflows and outflows. Because AAPL is such a large part of SPY and so many other indexes, direct investors who need inflows reflected by COB (close of business) execute this way. It's complex, but it has to do with the float of shares Apex and other clearing houses have sitting around and what they have to go and acquire that they don't have to manage orders that come in. For reference, a huge volume of orders come in to the clearinghouses at 2:30ET every trading day and they have to get float moved and trades placed and executed by market close.",13

Interest rates staying high, and people are starting to realize they will be for a while. 

Student loans picking back up this month.

Government shutdown looming and congress taking a 3 day weekend. 

Government downgrades from S&P and Fitch. 

Bank downgrades from moody's and S&P. 

People are starting to realize that lower inflation doesn't mean deflation, and high costs are here to stay. 

Credit card debt is at highest in history. And did I mention that the interest rates are high?

fears of china banning iphones, That one is murky, but the fear is real. 

Aging population, less people paying into retirement plans and more people moving to bonds and retiring. A fair chunk of the last huge rally was the boomers that didn't save for retirement trying to cram. I know guys who were contributing 40% to to their 401k... As they switch to zero contributions to the market, it's going to soften. 

And did I mention that even retail traders can get over 5% interest with no risk? Reducing the incentive to invest...

Buffet is holding a TON of cash. If you're into the oracle thing.

Regardless of how dumb that is, it refuted zero of what my claim was. No one said that Niger halted uranium supplies. Simply that Uranium is important and the French have been depressing the price for financial gain and cheaper European energy.

https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20230801-does-the-coup-in-niger-threaten-nuclear-power-plants-in-france

https://www.oxfam.org/en/press-releases/areva-niger-who-benefiting-uranium

https://reliefweb.int/report/niger/niger-uranium-blessing-or-curse

The government clearly believes that this can have an impact and they need to pivot the supply chain. They’re talking about energy independence because they see the Niger coup as volatility that could further increase EU energy prices. Couple that with a SHARP increase in uranium prices and it is obvious what is going on.

Please go away. People have been writing about the price discrenpency for decades. Either you’re dumb, work for the uranium company or the French government - in any case I’ll enjoy taking a profit.

God I have to keep editing this because it is so easy to show… take a look at a physical Uranium fund - SRUUF, URA, NLR - in the last month it has gone straight up with good volume.

I was simply responding to ""*...made me want to investigate just \*how\* significant this support level is*"" and ""*The Horizontal line represents...where the selloff was rejected THREE times!*""

That's all -- nothing directed at you whatsoever",2

Falling margins and revenue, raising prices to make up for falling sales numbers... the ""innovative"" apple can't even come up with a selling point for their new phone minus ""muh 11% better camera"" and ""this one's pink!"" 

good luck with those longs. maybe another day",1

I’m not an apple investor though. I personally think it’s overvalued and I’m short right now",1
