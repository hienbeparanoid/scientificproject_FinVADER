17sz3xi,Trying to understand this chart. Massive AAPL buy at 4 PM. But prices don't seem to synch with chart. 1. What was the actual closing price? 2. Why would a trading algorithm continue to buy at increasing higher prices? 3. How could you have played that trade? Is it even possible to get in? . :-),"Looks fine to me. The large institutional investors that use Apex Clearing House as their trade desk have designated windows for trading of their mutual funds and index funds to reflect inflows and outflows. Because AAPL is such a large part of SPY and so many other indexes, direct investors who need inflows reflected by COB (close of business) execute this way. It's complex, but it has to do with the float of shares Apex and other clearing houses have sitting around and what they have to go and acquire that they don't have to manage orders that come in. For reference, a huge volume of orders come in to the clearinghouses at 2:30ET every trading day and they have to get float moved and trades placed and executed by market close.",13

It almost looks like a software glitch. But it's not. Would the exchange just ignore it? You would have to flip your trades in seconds. And would do great. Seems too easy.

Government downgrades from S&P and Fitch. 

Bank downgrades from moody's and S&P.

fears of china banning iphones, That one is murky, but the fear is real.

Regardless of how dumb that is, it refuted zero of what my claim was. No one said that Niger halted uranium supplies. Simply that Uranium is important and the French have been depressing the price for financial gain and cheaper European energy.

The government clearly believes that this can have an impact and they need to pivot the supply chain. They‚Äôre talking about energy independence because they see the Niger coup as volatility that could further increase EU energy prices. Couple that with a SHARP increase in uranium prices and it is obvious what is going on.

Please go away. People have been writing about the price discrenpency for decades. Either you‚Äôre dumb, work for the uranium company or the French government - in any case I‚Äôll enjoy taking a profit.

The Horizontal line represents today's bottom wick, within cents of where the selloff was rejected THREE times!","i would take my position over yours any day. i was short at the top. ill always be a buyer at support, i dont short supports.

If you held a short from the top, this is where you close it, even if you don't necessarily go long.

If youre right tomorrow, it will only inscribe this bad habbit into your mind.

you should hope youre wrong for a lesson.",2

I was simply responding to ""*...made me want to investigate just \*how\* significant this support level is*"" and ""*The Horizontal line represents...where the selloff was rejected THREE times!*""

That's all -- nothing directed at you whatsoever",2

Falling margins and revenue, raising prices to make up for falling sales numbers... the ""innovative"" apple can't even come up with a selling point for their new phone minus ""muh 11% better camera"" and ""this one's pink!"" 

good luck with those longs. maybe another day",1

 I'm already short biased on AAPL",1

I‚Äôm not an apple investor though. I personally think it‚Äôs overvalued and I‚Äôm short right now",1
