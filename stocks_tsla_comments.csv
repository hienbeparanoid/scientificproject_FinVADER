I've been a TSLA shareholder since 2011.  I pay very close attention to the company's activities.

&#x200B;

>They even admit this today saying they are ""in-between growth waves"". **What does that mean.** When will the next mega growth wave be that justifies the insane market cap? 

It means that Tesla is in the process of building out new production lines that will enable faster growth in 2-3 years.

* Gigafactory Texas (just outside of Austin) is a huge building but still mostly empty.  Tesla has been installing a production line for Cybertruck, and appears to be building production  capacity for its next-generation vehicle (NGV), based on equipment being moved inside.  You can find plenty of drone flyover videos on YouTube.  I recommend Joe Tegtmeyer's channel for regular updates.  
* Gigafactory Berlin has enough newly cleared land area to triple in size
* Tesla is building a lithium refinery at Corpus Christi, Texas, to ensure lithium supply to both its Texas campus and future Mexico campus

&#x200B;

There's a lot going on at Tesla in terms of building infrastructure for the next-generation of vehicles around 2025.  

There's also a lot of work being done on the AI and robotics side of things, particularly with regard to development of custom silicon, AI training, and custom robotics hardware.",28

17vfy74,"TSLA claims ""We're in-between growth waves"", stock up 6%","Tesla is the far away leader of the EV market (not counting china) and it‚Äôs not even close. ‚ÄúCompetitors‚Äù have absolutely shit the bed with profitability on EVs and production numbers to keep up. Tesla has pricing power to drive demand when needed. The only people who seem to deny this are those who are ideologically compromised and cannot make an honest judgement on Tesla as a company because they are clouded by their opinions on Elon. People should be very cautious about making investments, shorts or going long, on any stock they have emotional investment into, you need to hold a cold detached opinion.

Ford announced its nine month EBIT loss in the EV segment to be 3.1 billion ( https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/ford-withdraws-2023-forecast-warns-ev-results-2023-10-26/#:~:text=Ford%20said%20its%20EV%20unit,the%20Ford%20Model%20e%20unit.) this is just one example.

17vfy74,"TSLA claims ""We're in-between growth waves"", stock up 6%","Your problem is, macro-economics must be learned along with fundamentals of an individual company. If TSLA announces bad news, and the stock drops, but macro is positive (big fiscal flows/govt spending/good GDP, lowering inflation...etc), then people buying the market (SPY/QQQ, other ETF's), will be buying TSLA. You can't take TSLA out of all the ETF's/bundles/mutual funds. So buying pressure flows naturally. Esp with pensions buying SP500 companies. It's like trying to stop water coming out from a hose. Sometimes the hose shuts off, but usually the best advice is to not time the market, which means that you should always be buying to get the best cost-basis.

So, buying puts into a strong economy is tricky, because the buy pressure comes from ppl unknowingly buying Tesla also, as they scoop up mutual funds and ETF's. Probably easier to buy puts on companies not in the sp500 tbh.",4

And their veichle deliveries still grew a lot year over year, if no more price cuts they will grow revenue again.

Numerous analysts and firms point out that if Tesla were to be deemed an automaker, automaker multiples would value it $50-90 per share.  

Steve Eisner, short on Tesla over 5-6 years, is currently short again and says he will remain so until $100 or less, and that it's headed to $50.  

Jim Cramer openly says he ignores the fundamentals, pinches his nose, and has faith in the ""pitchman"" to drive the price higher.  

Even analyst banks who are bullish on it have breakdowns in which they acknowledge that more than half of current valuation is derived from side businesses that won't even have any revenue until 2028 or later.  

I find it too tricky to play.  As much as I want to avoid going near anything their fraudulent founder touches, I believe that other people hired there are doing the actual work, doing the actual engineering, running the actual business, and those people likely make up for his deficiencies.  I do wonder if he ever found the right treatment to stop acting how he is, and if they hired a cool designer, and then launched some truly marketable new generations of their vehicles, they could take some market share as an automaker.

So that‚Äôs:
2020: 500,000
2021: 750,000
2022: 1,125,000
2023: 1,687,500
2024: 2,531,250
2025: 3,796,875

So 2020/2021 was the middle of Model 3/Y major ramp period. In 2023, guidance was for 1.8 million, which is well ahead of the 1.69 million necessary to keep with the long term. 50% CAGR target. They appear to be on course to get pretty close to the 1.8 million mark for 2023.

However, bringing production online is always stair steps. And 2024 may not meet the 2.5 million mark to keep the long term target, as the next gen vehicle plant won‚Äôt be online quick enough to make a significant contribution for that. Originally, they were going to build their next gen vehicle in Mexico, but they decided to expand their Austin factory instead and Mexico would come later.

As it stands, they have roughly 650,000 capacity in Fremont, 1.1 million in Shanghai, 250,000 in Berlin, and 175,000 in Austin. So their current capacity is near 2.2 million. They are expanding both Berlin and Austin, so they have a shot at being able to produce 2.5 million in 2024. The factory footprint is there for expanding Austin to 500,000 (Model Y + Cybertruck) but it is unlikely they will be able to scale up to all of that for 2024, but may hit that as a run rate at the end of 2024.

So YoY, they are probably looking at 30-35% growth with a shot at higher, with next gen coming online at end of 2024 or in 2025. For their long term target, they may come in about 10-15% shy of their long term 2024 target. For 2025/2026, they should have the next big step up in production capacity to hit or exceed their long term CAGR guidance.",1

17vfy74,"TSLA claims ""We're in-between growth waves"", stock up 6%","Tesla lost plenty of money while they were ramping up production as well.  While I agree that Tesla will almost certainly run the other EV-only carmakers out of business, the legacy automakers have a profitable ICE business to subsidize their losses until they get to full production.

Looking at traditional car sites, like Car & Driver, Teslas are already ranked in the mid to back of the pack of their categories.  Traditional car drivers seem unlikely to shift in masse to Teslas, which drive significantly different than an ICE car; they are favoring the legacy carmakers that give a more traditional driving experience with their EVs.

Tesla seems to be settling in as a niche carmaker.  They will have a relatively small share of drivers, but those will be loyal customers.  Eventually, their stock will be valued at the value of its future cash flows.  To me, this seems like it will be a number a little less than the current $700B - not enough to justify a short position, but a not a buy either.",-6

There's a lot of activity on site in terms of equipment installation for new production lines.

Installed line capacity today at Giga Texas is 250,000 Model Y/year and 125,000 Cybertruck/year.  That is only a fraction of what I believe will be the ultimate production volume of somewhere between 1-2 million vehicles/year at the site",3

People are switching to EVs at an incremental rate, people who try Teslas usually stay with Tesla (at least for now), as the other guy said, keep in mind most Tesla haters are just ideologically compromised, they hate Tesla because it's managed by Elon and that's all there is to it.

Right now there's no real Tesla competitors, it's all meme companies that lose billions, or big automakers losing billions, or some Chinese subsidized company that isn't really profitable but hey they got CCP backing so w/e.",12
17vfy74,"TSLA claims ""We're in-between growth waves"", stock up 6%","A lot of what you wrote shows how misinformed you are about the auto market and the EV transition. Just off the top of my head:

* ICE profits won't last. Eventually 100% of the cars sold will be EV's, no one, not even the traditional automakers are pretending otherwise on this.

* The problem for the traditional automakers is that the EV transition isn't going to go in a straight line, it's been going in an exponential S-curve. While EV adoption had a slower start in the US by comparison, you can look ahead at other regions like Europe and China to see how it's going to turn out in the US sooner or later. 

* Point being, consumer sentiment WILL shift in favor of EV's in much larger numbers sooner or later, and if traditional automakers aren't ready then they're going to feel a lot of pain as their ICE sales tank, especially if they can't produce and sell enough EV's to counter-act those ICE losses.

* The other problem with the above points is that it takes 3 years on average for a car to go from the idea/design phase to being brought to the market and put in the hands of consumers. So it's quite possible that traditional automakers will run out of time to make the transition and be screwed. This is already happening to a number of automakers in China where they aren't going to be allowed to sell some types of ICE vehicles very soon.

Bottom line, I don't see anyway around it, some automakers are going to go bankrupt because they fail to make the transition to EV's, or at the very least will need bailed out by the government. The fact that so many automakers are pushing the break on their shift to the EV transition lately is really going to screw them over in the next few years.",9

17vfy74,"TSLA claims ""We're in-between growth waves"", stock up 6%",">What exactly are the market advantages tesla has over other car companies? 

&#x200B;

(1) Software.  Compare Tesla's user interface to that of a Hyundai Ionic 5 or Volkswagen ID.4.  Tesla's interface is smoother and easier to use.  Tesla's control of their entire hardware platform and software stack, means they can more easily update their software.  Ford CEO Jim Farley explains the basic problem for other car companies:  [the software is all written by 150 different companies and they don‚Äôt talk to each other,  Even if I had a high-speed modem in the vehicle and I had the ability to write their software, it's actually their IP.](https://www.thedrive.com/news/ford-ceo-explains-why-legacy-automakers-take-forever-to-issue-ota-updates)

Ford is trying to bring this stuff back in-house, but it remains to be seen if they can recruit the talent necessary to do all the hardware and software themselves.  Volkswagen has thus far done a mediocre job of this (which in part [cost former VW CEO Herber Diess his own job](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/volkswagens-ceo-diess-leave-company-2022-07-22/))

&#x200B;

(2) Hardware.  Tesla has had entire teams devoted to developing custom silicon for its autonomous driving and AI projects.  Chips like HW3, HW4, and Dojo D1 give Tesla a big edge, as they can get the performance and efficiency specs they want, on the algorithms they plan to run.  

&#x200B;

(3) Economies of scale.  Tesla builds an order of magnitude more EVs for the U.S. market than its competitors: [https://www.evautoblog.com/news/tesla-model-3-and-y-still-dominating-u-s-ev-market-shows-data/](https://www.evautoblog.com/news/tesla-model-3-and-y-still-dominating-u-s-ev-market-shows-data/).  For example, they make about 10x more EVs than Ford.  With economies of scale, come cost benefits.  Competitors, except Chinese, are hurting:

* [Ford hits the brakes on $12 billion in EV spending because EVs are too expensive](https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/26/23934172/ford-12-billion-ev-investment-postpone-q3-earnings)
* [Honda CEO says firm is ending partnership with GM to develop affordable EVs](https://fortune.com/2023/10/25/honda-ceo-ending-partnership-gm-develop-affordable-evs-uaw-strike-automaker/)
* [Volkswagen to temporarily cut production of two EV models due to weaker demand](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/volkswagen-temporarily-pause-production-two-ev-car-models-due-drop-demand-2023-09-26/)

Note that Tesla continues to expand its economies of scale in the long run, by building its own lithium refining operations at Corpus Christi, TX, and continuing to scale up its in-house battery cell manufacturing capacity.  

&#x200B;

(4) Products beyond automotive

* Tesla sells stationary storage battery products (about a 6 Billion/year business from latest SEC filings), which is growing very rapidly and turns a profit at higher margins than cars.

That is just not true.

>ICE profits won't last. Eventually 100% of the cars sold will be EV's, no one, not even the traditional automakers are pretending otherwise on this.

That's nonsense.  ICE cars will be apart of the market for the foreseeable future, several decades at least.  There are significant parts of the market where EVs simply are not practical with current or foreseeable technology; it is just fantasy to think otherwise.

None of they legacy automakers have any plans to shut down there ICE production; you are simply making that up.

>The problem for the traditional automakers is that the EV transition isn't going to go in a straight line, it's been going in an exponential S-curve

No, that's just an absurd claim.  EV early adopters are already in the market.  The mass market is skeptical about EVs; many don't have easy access to charging, drive to much, or in isolated areas, to make charging practical.

Consumer demand is simply not there for a huge market shift in the near term.  Automakers are slowing their EV rollouts specifically for this reason.

>Point being, consumer sentiment WILL shift in favor of EV's in much larger numbers sooner or later, and if traditional automakers aren't ready then they're going to feel a lot of pain as their ICE sales tank, especially if they can't produce and sell enough EV's to counter-act those ICE losses.

ICE SUVs and trucks are where the consumer demand is.  It i going to be a long haul for EVs to chip away at that market share.  Consumers are already pushing back on increasing the EV mix, and forcing automakers to delay rollouts because of a lack of demand.  Your claim doesn't jibe with the reality in the market.

>The other problem with the above points is that it takes 3 years on average for a car to go from the idea/design phase to being brought to the market and put in the hands of consumers. So it's quite possible that traditional automakers will run out of time to make the transition and be screwed.

Again, it is absurd to think that mass market EV transition is going to be in the next 3 years; it will take several decades, and ICE vehicles are likely to still have a significant part of the market after that.

>China where they aren't going to be allowed to sell some types of ICE vehicles very soon

Government mandate like that won't fly in most of the US.  If the government feels the need to force consumers into a new technology, that is an indicator that the technology isn't ready for the mass market.  You are undermining your own argument here.

>I don't see anyway around it, some automakers are going to go bankrupt because they fail to make the transition to EV's

You need to look at the realities of the market.  ICE demand is strong, and the mass market is wary of EV tech.  You are just completely misreading the situation; just like most new tech, early adopters have jumped in, but it is going to be a long slog to get most of the market to transition.  We are talking decades here; not years.

Not true.

> The big automakers are losing money because they are building a new product, just like Tesla lost money when it was building a new product.

They started 10 years too late and the market is already largely taken, they can't sell EVs for ridiculous prices because people won't get them since there's options.

> So you are pointing out that there are so many competitors that the market is splitting up between them. You are supporting my argument that Tesla is a niche player.

Last year Tesla's market share was 71%, very niche indeed, this year now that there's more competition (particularly in the high end market, which isn't as largely affected by the current economic context) you can actually buy from it's just 57%, then again they're also selling more than last year, the market just grew. By the way, depending on what model you want to get from them there might be waiting time, they literally can't keep up with demand. Meanwhile their competitors have their EVs sitting in a parking lot lol.

> That is just not true.

Their competitors are either inferior, don't really compete with them (selling a $300k EV Porsche that loses Porsche a fortune isn't exactly competition, they aim for a different kind of people) or are going at a massive loss that they won't be able to afford. Again, they won't be able to sell their just-came-out-from-R&D cars for $100k, they'll have to sell them for 1/5 of that, and that'll cost them too much.

> You ignored my point that actual reviews are out there; the Car & Driver ratings show that Teslas are near the back of the pack in every category of EV. You are ignoring what the market is saying; the facts prove you wrong.

Reviews are not trustworthy, especially when Tesla has pretty much all of the media against it. What matters is market share and market valuation, which strongly supports my argument. Tesla is worth more than every other trying-to-get-into-the-EV-market company combined, they sell almost twice as much as all of them combined, while having big future prospects in other areas.",2

Companies that don't build their own infotainment systems then pay licensing money to Apple and Google, and have no control over the overall experience of the system.  

Your take on the car electronic control systems is incorrect.  It is much slower to create and update software when the electronic control systems are made by dozens or even over 100 suppliers.  Did you read what the Ford CEO said?  Trying to integrate 150 pieces of software from systems created by other companies is difficult and time consuming.  

The number of car models released has nothing to do with Tesla's electronic controls architecture.  They all use a common computing system.  Their product lineup is the result of deliberate choices not to complicate manufacturing.

17j4q1u,We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),"Overall I think Tesla will come out just fine/ too early to be worried about Tesla.   Tesla is taking steps to prepare for lessening in demand due to inflation and interest rate increases.

They have basically no debt compare to the amount of cash they are holding. They are cash flow positive and they are continuing to build up the amount they are holding.

They are able to cut pricing aggressively to generate demand while still making money on each sale while their competitors are losing money on every EV.

On Cybertruck - it‚Äôs normal for any new product to take a while to make back the initial investment in new production lines, it was the case for all the previous models Tesla produced. It will likely be priced higher than the initial introduction due to inflation and with higher interest rate there will be an impact on demand. Given they are starting with the more expensive trim, it hard to tell how much of an impact there will be since people with higher income will be less affected by interest rate.

FSD - personally I use it on my drives and it‚Äôs worth it for the initial price I got it at 5k, 5 years ago. It‚Äôs been amazing to see the progress it has made. 
For people who drive a lot, I think it‚Äôs worth getting the subscription at the current state. I view FSD / AI as nice bonus, Tesla is not going to die in if they don‚Äôt figure it out in the near future.

The energy storage business is growing very fast and has high margins, it‚Äôll be an area to watch for on how interest rate impacts the growth.",37
17j4q1u,We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),"I'll try to play devil's advocate and present you the thought process from a fund perspective. Whenever you're considering a play, the best thing to do is to first evaluate it in the context of its industry. You've gone very granular into the risks of Tesla, but haven't really presented it in the context versus competitors (i.e comparing TSLA's book metrics vs competitors, product cost/benefit vs competitors, etc). In other words, the first thing to ask yourself is are you actually truly bearish just Tesla or just bearish the entire auto/EV industry?

&nbsp;

From a buyside institutional perspective, the reason why that question above is so important is because when presenting a trade thesis, you have to consider not just idea generation, but also **idea execution.** 

&nbsp;

So this brings me to the next point: what if in the extreme case, I told you institutions were short every auto/EV (i.e industry short) and long TSLA over the five year span I mentioned? You mention that ""the 857% total return of Tesla is substantially higher than all of its peers, including Ford, Toyota, and Volkswagen."" What if I told you institutions holding TSLA are ""only"" up 100% total return in that span? Sure, there are going to be institutions that will only hold a long TSLA as representative bet on the industry, but by in large those will be the minority of funds.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


> Elon Musk has previously alluded to a poor performing EV market in the wake of a higher interest rate environment. Economic data confirms this narrative as Automobile shipments have declined substantially in Q3‚Äô 2023.

&nbsp;

Here, you seem to hint at industry decline. So again, why would I worry specifically about Tesla and not the whole industry? Why would I not short the entire industry altogether? And this brings me to my ultimate point: from a very long term perspective, unless you have a negative view of EVs as a whole industry, the risk adjusted returns of a long TSLA and short the ""others"" pair trade is far preferable to taking idiosyncratic, or company specific, risk.",31

Still rather go to grocery store then tp buy the food to be cheap unless time value.  If that's the case.

Make better vending machine food.
Japan already has it.  In usa if they make it they will cost 5x the cost of a grocery store and 2x the convince store.

The real cost is rent not labor remember that.  Owners Play the wages are too high when they never ever went up with inflation.  Really it's rent is too high.

If wages too high the employer can do it themselves they realize it's not worth it because wages too low.

There is a reason why employers won't do the same job employees do.  They see it as beneath them and pay isn't worththe amount if work being done meaning the wages are too low in The first place if it went to where it's worth it for employer to consider doing it themselves they would.

Cybertruck is going to be a damper on profits for a bit, but I suspect the only reason it's going to be a dark horse for a bit is because it's coming out just as interest rates and auto loans jump up.

I dont think TSLA is in trouble at all right now. This isnt the first elon announcement and this isnt the first time a new product line has popped up creating doubt.

The model 3 almost killed the company, and then made it insanely profitable, then the Model Y dropped and practically printed money.

Some investors give them HUGE valuation because they think Tesla is way ahead on FSD due to the amount of data they collect.

I don't understand how anyone could arrive at this conclusion. The entire reason that hybrids exist is to combat the mileage you get on an EV charge, but that's continuing to improve, and will eventually get to the point of being as long range as gas is. What reason would hybrids have to exist after that, other than to fuel (no pun intended) the oil industry?",13

17j4q1u,We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),"It's enterprise value is so much higher than its competitors because its market cap is so much higher than its competitors. When you're talking using any metric involving market cap, you're really comparing market value of a company and not book value.

&nbsp;

I have absolutely no view on Tesla or the EV market, but why not also first compare metrics that aren't affected by public sentiment (like market cap or enterprise value are). At the simplest level compared to its competitors (thus far, and not speaking about the future), Tesla's profit margins far, far outperform on a per vehicle basis as well as on a holistic company basis. How about its free cash flow? R&D spend vs competitors? Top and bottom line projected growth vs. competitors?

&nbsp;

So the two ""company specific"" aspects to Tesla you've presented as negative catalysts, FSD and Cybertruck, are interesting. FSD is truly company specific to Tesla, but Cybertruck is not really. What I mean by this is that auto/EV makers (which is Tesla's main industry) all have the same risks from this categorical new product launch (i.e GM with EV Hummer for instance, Rivian etc). As far as I'm aware, none of the major competitors to Tesla of them have the risks that FSD presents.

That has already turned out not to be true. And especially with cheaper and cheaper EVs, there will be no room for hybrids.

It's based on absolutely nothing tangible. 1M units is the low-ball of the century when talking about Cybertruck.

17j4q1u,We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),Stating the obvious. Am sure everyone here knows this. Doesnt take away from the fact that they have the same CEO and synergies that are taken advantage of. Both in terms of the resources they share as well as technological synergies (such as the FSD example I sourced w the article).,1
17j4q1u,We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),remindme! 5 years,1
17j4q1u,We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),I will help you see why. Ford literally had a negative net income of $2 Billion in 2022. Where as Tesla profited $12 Billion of net income. They make multiple times more money per car when compared to the operating margins of Ford and they have a tiny fraction of the debt Ford does.,10
17j4q1u,We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),"Can you see why Apple is worth more than rotary phone makers?

Ford is failing to build and sell EVs at scale at a profit.  Tesla can (they would do better margin in a lower interest rate environment, or if they pulled their heads out of their asses and actually advertised)",1

17j4q1u,We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),"Yup.

Just like how OP cherry picked the 857% return",1
17j4q1u,We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),"And slightly different profit..

""More importantly, Waymo and Cruise aren't viable businesses at the moment. GM posted a net loss of $791 million in the third quarter from Cruise, and it's lost $2 billion through the first three quarters of the year. Meanwhile, Cruise has brought in just $76 million in revenue during that time.

Alphabet doesn't break out Waymo's revenue, filing it in with its ""other bets,"" which reported revenue of $297 million in the third quarter and an operating loss of $1.2 billion.""",3

17j4q1u,We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),"and that's fine, but that's not the product Musk was selling. And as it pertains to the stock, what they are selling now is not a revenue driver in the future. 

If it ever does what they said it would, yes it would be. And sure, for people who drive long stretches on the highway, it's great for that. 

But ""full"" SD it certainly is not. 

I think they ultimately throw in the towel, call it something else and sell it as a subscription service for like $100 a month. 

I think when it becomes publicly accepted that they can't get FSD to work, Tesla immediately gets knocked down 25% on the stock price.",-3

17j4q1u,We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),Yep. I got to visit the BMW autonomous driving center in Munich 6 years ago and even back then they were saying they had collected petabytes (1000x TB) of data.

17j4q1u,We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),Tesla isn't a luxury or high quality brand either though lol.,20
17j4q1u,We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),"$40-$50k isn't luxury prices in 2023, so it isn't really that crazy to spend that on a Hyundai. 

It also isn't necessarily the case that Hyundai *can't* make a quality car just because their focus has historically been on cheaper quality but more affordable cars. And with EVs being intrinsically expensive up to now, Hyundai and Kia have focused on quality with their EVs over affordability.

Additionally, higher quality than Tesla is a really low bar. When I bought my Kia EV (2020) Teslas had terrible soundproofing (in a $45k vehicle) and heat pumps that kept the cabin warm were failing. At some point Tesla removed radar from their vehicles to save money, while no other manufacturer did the same (they may have since added it back, not sure). And they still don't have instrument panels, purely for the purpose of making manufacturing cheaper/easier. Call me crazy but if I'm spending $40k for a vehicle I expect an instrument panel, and every other manufacturer manages to offer that.",3
17j4q1u,We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),Agreed. I love the look of the g wagon,2

17j4q1u,We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),He meant in the term of valuation if you read his post at all.,4
17j4q1u,We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),You should worry should you not if you have shares at current price and it is objectively overvalued even for a growth stock. Is that not something to worry about if the market cap may go down 50% in the next year? (Elon himself said the next year at least will be bad due to high inflation),0
17j4q1u,We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),"Yes I am aware that tesla is a growth Stock. If you factor in rate of growth on last quarter and forecast from Elon himself for the next year i don't know how you came to the conclusion it is ""a little overvalued""
Comparing it to Amazon makes no sense",2
17j4q1u,We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),"I never said it wasn't growing, it has to grow at a rate that justifies its current market cap which it isn't. You don't seem to understand how to calculate an expected valuation based on earnings over the past 5 years. If you did you would see it is overvalued, growing but not worth $650bn. What part other than the auto business is making tesla money?",2
17j4q1u,We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),"It really mostly is once you look at actual numbers. Anybody can dress a guy into a robot suit, put him on stage, and claim they'll be a major AI/robot player, but so far the overwhelming source of sales is cars.",-1
17j4q1u,We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),"Electricity is not the answer to everything and govt is placing too many bets on that without positioning the grid to support their plays.  This is either going to cause energy prices to go out of control, or the EV push to fail.  ICE will win that battle, and hybrids are the feel-good middle ground.

EVs are net-negative energy-wise at the national and global level.  There are energy losses involved with charging and sitting idle that are just wasting energy that could otherwise be used elsewhere.  The only reason these cars are cheaper to operate is they are subsidized thru tax credits and lower excise taxes.  That will eventually go away and operating costs will skyrocket.

EVs are also propped up by the climate change fictions.  At some point that will be unsustainable too.  The warning sign there will be a shift in R&D and academia toward some other large technology cash cow massive project they can use as a revenue stream for their industry.  Nuclear gen IV and asteroid defense are too specialized.  It may be actual AI (not the current marketing-speak and word and imaging shuffling nonsense everyone is rolling out), or maybe some pharma based project like anti-cancer or some such which could actually be positive in the long run and not just a climate change style money grab.",-2
17j4q1u,We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),"Typically you would use Enterprise value instead of market cap when the industry has a lot of debt. For example Ford market cap is 40 billion but its enterprise value is 140 billion. It more accurately assesses the size of the companies. Tesla is at risk because they have the most growth in its valuation.

As for margins, Tesla's margins are now worse than Toyota despite having higher ASPs. I cannot speak with confidence without checking my model on the other things you mentioned.

I would say my post was more about highlighting shady business practices by Tesla and Elon. When so much of a company's valuation is based around growth, highlighting these tactics are essential.",-3

Gross margins have compressed to around (slightly below if I recall correctly) Toyota's levels and Tesla has been aggressively dropping prices despite being in the most subsidized segment of the industry.

What percentage of those $100 deposits do you expect to convert? 

Again, Tesla could have charged thousands like they did with the Roadster. They chose $100 for a reason. That reason was to impress Wall Street with claims of incredible demand. If you cannot at least acknowledge that, I am not in a serious conversation.",-1

Not quite. It builds the brand, making Tesla the default EV for everyone.

>Also, Honda made robots and Hyundai owns a little robot company named Boston Dynamics which last I looked made robots that are slightly more impressive than Elon‚Äôs stupid demo.

Neither of these have succeeded in making mass-produced robots.

BD has been doing this for 30 years, and have little to show apart from impressive tech demos. Tesla has been doing it for a couple of years, and are already way ahead of what everyone thought was possible.

17j4q1u,We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),"Oh I didn‚Äôt realize you were one of them.
Did you read the deposit was $100. You are brain dead if you think that even 20% of those will convert to sales. It‚Äôs actually something called common sense. If you were actually well read about finance or business in general, you would know that low commitment refundable deposits do not convert on high ticket vehicles.

Also, for level 3 I‚Äôm citing Tesla‚Äôs letter to California that states they have no intent to go beyond level 2 for the foreseeable future. Oh and promising FSD to be fully autonomous every year for 7 years is completely ignored. Best case scenario you are dealing with a fool and worst case scenario this is fraud. I think the problem is that you didn‚Äôt research the company. Instead, you probably got your info from a TSLA subreddit lmao.

As a nail in the coffin, the redundancy that is going to be required to reach level 3 is non existent on Tesla. Why do you think Tesla has 0 level 3 cars in testing in cities? Maybe because the hardware required to actually meet the standards is missing. LiDAR HD mapping radar all missing. Meanwhile every competitor is doing the same thing with computer vision and more.

They are usually out within 12 hours to fix something that broke if they cant reboot it remotely. If you have a Tesla, you can see which stalls are broken in realtime and it tells you to avoid those, or if a SC is down, it will notify you on your trip and have you re-route to another one.

They don't really have on-site monitoring. All their data capture is remote (just like EA or all the other charging networks). Their hardware is just a lot simpler - and therfore more robust. 

Reliability may go down a bit with the new v4 chargers (as these incorporate screens and payment options which are poits of failure). But overall the software side (e.g. handshake implementation) seems to be much better implemented. Also the payment module isn't third party (at least I think it isn't) - so the software integration that way should be more robust.",3

Discount the third factor and Tesla is still not all that overvalued, with a PEG ratio of 1.3 as of a few months ago. (Ideally that would be 1.0, but some of the other big techs are a good bit higher.)",3

Unclear.  If dealing with the remaining edge cases were as simple as just solving them, then I would say Tesla is very near.  But AI does not work like that.  They have to solve the edge cases without screwing up the stuff that already works well.  And that is where we get into ultra-cutting-edge technology that nobody can predict well.  

The fact that Tesla has moved from heuristics to a fully end-to-end system should improve progress.  But unless you work for Tesla's AI team, I doubt you can shine much light on this.  

Ultimately it comes down to how much you believe in Tesla's AI team.

I've been a TSLA shareholder since 2011, and was a participating member at Tesla Motors Club investor forums for much of the 2010s.  

Many of Tesla's largest, long-term retail investors (some with 400,000 to 500,000 or more TSLA shares) have significant professional expertise in engineering, computer science, and business.  It was that expertise that led many to conclude that the conventional wisdom about Tesla was incorrect.  

The unsophisticated investors who maybe buy a few shares on their Robinhood accounts, don't have the financial firepower to prop up a 700 Billion market cap.  

Looking at TSLA trading volume alone, an average of about 115 million shares traded daily over the past month, according to Yahoo Finance, that amounts to 10s of Billions of $ worth of shares trading hands every day.   This is not something that small retail can have much effect on.",4

This is important for valuation models that drive the price of the stock price due to TVM. My argument is perfectly logical when valuing the company... I would assume you are not a finance person, so your ignorance is tolerable.

""You do not need a level 3 or 4 system to build an autonomous car""

This is a self-contradicting statement. An autonomous car is a level 3+ system. Why is Tesla not testing any of these systems? Maybe because they are not close... Meanwhile Waymo and Mobileye have Level 4 systems with no one in the driver seat. You are essentially saying that Tesla should not focus on real autonomous driving and instead focus on gimmicks.

For anyone new out there like you, rides without critical disengagements need to be substantially higher than 94% to be safe. Tesla's safety is worse than drunk drivers. So they fail the first test. The second test is rides without disengagements which measures the actual effectiveness of a system. Tesla is around 30-40% which is abysmal. An autonomous vehicle needs to be above 99% for both categories. for critical disengagement around 99.999%

I have been following Waymo's progress for a long time and I think they're already 90% of the way there, and Alphabet has basically infinite resources to improve the technology to the point of commercialization. They are fenced into SF right now but that's mostly for regulatory reasons, which if we're honest is probably a good chunk of the reason that Tesla is still only rated for level 2.

Waymo is already mostly there as far as I am concerned, where the car can drive on its own in a variety of conditions for extended periods of time. For the foreseeable future, there are and still will be edge case scenarios where the car needs to pull over and ask for human input. Progress is all about minimizing the number of times that it happens.

The big problem that I have with Tesla is that they break ethics, rules and regulations at every turn. They basically gave a level 2 system over to the public and marketed it as a level 4 system. They have less safeties in place so the car is more likely to just keep going and blame the driver for not taking over and avoiding the accident when something inevitably goes wrong. It has given FSD a bad name with serious crashes and fatalities, and they have worked harder to cover up any blame that Tesla might have for these incidents than they have spent investigating to find out what went wrong and how to fix it.

Many people sold their TSLA shares in a panic during various points like early 2016 and early 2019.  I continued to hold because my research indicated that the panics were unjustified and due to transitory factors.

>Tesla was on the verge of bankruptcy not even a decade ago.

They were on the verge of bankruptcy for almost all of the 2010s.  I kept a very close eye on their cash burn rate, ability to raise capital, their debts (10+ Billion at the peak), and the interest rate and maturity date of those debts.  Most or even all of this is/was publicly available in the 10-Q and 10-K filings.  

I also was able to make an educated guess at what level of production, sales, and margin Tesla would need to escape that black hole of debt.

> Tesla ending up as it is today is luck. 

**Nothing is all luck or all skill.**

Yes, there was some element of luck to TSLA.

If a random big earthquake had destroyed Tesla's Fremont factory at some point in the mid-2010s, Tesla probably would've gone bankrupt.  That would have been bad luck.  And it wouldn't have been unprecedented either -- the 2011 Tsunami, caused by an earthquake, severely disrupted Japanese automotive production.

If Russia had assassinated Elon Musk in the 2010s in an attempt to slow SpaceX, that would probably have led to Tesla going bankrupt during 2017-2018 ""production hell"".  That would have been bad luck too.

Tesla was lucky that legacy automakers were mostly complacent for most of the 2010s, and asleep not only to Tesla's rise, but the rise of the Chinese EV industry too.",2

17j4q1u,We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),"PEG uses earnings results over the past five years and then takes an average, this is inherently misleading when taking into consideration its past three earnings reports. During this 5 year period tesla has delivered an impressive amount of growth there's no doubt. But i think you're ignoring the clear decline in growth that the previous 3 quarters have shown. EPS Q4 2022 1.13, Q1 2023 0.85, Q2 2023 0.91, Q3 0.62. You're looking into the past assuming that a growth stock will continue to grow at the same rate as it has done in the past but that is never the case and as an investment stategy is speculative at best.

After a period of sharp exponential growth there usually follows a flattening of growth, and the evidence of the past quarters is showing we are nearing that stage.

You're also ignoring the CEO's own prediction that income will decline due to increased competition and high inflation rates worldwide and the fact they have slashed prices on their cars to gain market share but cutting their own profit margin on sale which will inevitably have a negative effect on their earnings compared to 2022 and 2021.",1

17j4q1u,We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),">Buying a company with no factories or revenue in 2011 is entirely luck. 

That is not entirely true, and also misses the bigger picture.

Tesla was setting up the initial production line for Model S in 2011.  The company had bought [what is now the Tesla Factory at Fremont](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Fremont_Factory) from Toyota in 2010, after Toyota and GM shut down the NUMMI joint venture they'd previously operated there.  

The broader picture you miss is that Tesla in 2011 had a lot of talent.  The efforts of talented people are more important in a startup than the factory.  It's the talent that brings the organization to life.

Tesla's leadership team in 2011 was excellent: CTO J.B. Straubel, Model S program director Jerome Guillen (hired from Daimler), manufacturing operations executive Gilbert Passin (hired from Toyota), VP of business development Diarmuid O'Connell, VP of worldwide retail George Blankenship (former Apple exec who had developed Apple stores), and probably several others I'm forgetting at the moment.  CEO Elon Musk, as controversial as he is today, had put together a star management team.  These people were worth investing in.

> If anything, your decision to hold a company that nearly went bankrupt multiple times shows how incompetent you were. 

No, this is called taking a calculated risk.  

My purchases of TSLA stock over the past 12 years represent only a small % of the total money I used to buy investments.  

I've ploughed the vast majority of my savings since 1997 into boring index funds and ETFs like SPY.  

If TSLA had gone bankrupt in 2013 or 2019, my daily finances and long-term retirement plans would have been unaffected.",2
