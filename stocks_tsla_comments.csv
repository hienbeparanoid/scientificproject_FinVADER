&#x200B;

>They even admit this today saying they are ""in-between growth waves"". **What does that mean.** When will the next mega growth wave be that justifies the insane market cap? 

It means that Tesla is in the process of building out new production lines that will enable faster growth in 2-3 years.

* Gigafactory Texas (just outside of Austin) is a huge building but still mostly empty.  Tesla has been installing a production line for Cybertruck, and appears to be building production  capacity for its next-generation vehicle (NGV), based on equipment being moved inside.  You can find plenty of drone flyover videos on YouTube.  I recommend Joe Tegtmeyer's channel for regular updates.  
* Gigafactory Berlin has enough newly cleared land area to triple in size
* Tesla is building a lithium refinery at Corpus Christi, Texas, to ensure lithium supply to both its Texas campus and future Mexico campus

&#x200B;

There's a lot going on at Tesla in terms of building infrastructure for the next-generation of vehicles around 2025.  

There's also a lot of work being done on the AI and robotics side of things, particularly with regard to development of custom silicon, AI training, and custom robotics hardware.",28

17vfy74,"TSLA claims ""We're in-between growth waves"", stock up 6%","Tesla is the far away leader of the EV market (not counting china) and it’s not even close. “Competitors” have absolutely shit the bed with profitability on EVs and production numbers to keep up. Tesla has pricing power to drive demand when needed. The only people who seem to deny this are those who are ideologically compromised and cannot make an honest judgement on Tesla as a company because they are clouded by their opinions on Elon. People should be very cautious about making investments, shorts or going long, on any stock they have emotional investment into, you need to hold a cold detached opinion.

Ford announced its nine month EBIT loss in the EV segment to be 3.1 billion ( https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/ford-withdraws-2023-forecast-warns-ev-results-2023-10-26/#:~:text=Ford%20said%20its%20EV%20unit,the%20Ford%20Model%20e%20unit.) this is just one example.

17vfy74,"TSLA claims ""We're in-between growth waves"", stock up 6%","Your problem is, macro-economics must be learned along with fundamentals of an individual company. If TSLA announces bad news, and the stock drops, but macro is positive (big fiscal flows/govt spending/good GDP, lowering inflation...etc), then people buying the market (SPY/QQQ, other ETF's), will be buying TSLA. You can't take TSLA out of all the ETF's/bundles/mutual funds. So buying pressure flows naturally. Esp with pensions buying SP500 companies. It's like trying to stop water coming out from a hose. Sometimes the hose shuts off, but usually the best advice is to not time the market, which means that you should always be buying to get the best cost-basis.

And their veichle deliveries still grew a lot year over year, if no more price cuts they will grow revenue again.

I'm not bullish on them the next 6 months either but to call them the easiest money play out there is just highly smooth brained, this is a stock that could just as easily hit 300 xmas as oppsed to150 the next 6 months. You are just gambling and now you are betting against the trend.",3

People really believe Musks companies will rescue ourselves from the excesses of capitalism. Investors are simply hedging their bets around climate change, and you can’t totally blame them for trying by using the tools they’ve been taught. But consumption, and the pollution and environmental damage generated from it, is precisely what causes climate change. Yeah, EVs don’t emit as much greenhouse gases when you accelerate, but the are still made of petroleum products and serviced with petroleum lubricants on petroleum roads, shipped across the ocean on massive barges, where everything was manufactured, refined, and mined by carbon-heavy industrial processes. Then after all that waste, the product will just be tossed into a landfill after 10 years.

Numerous analysts and firms point out that if Tesla were to be deemed an automaker, automaker multiples would value it $50-90 per share.  

Steve Eisner, short on Tesla over 5-6 years, is currently short again and says he will remain so until $100 or less, and that it's headed to $50.  

Jim Cramer openly says he ignores the fundamentals, pinches his nose, and has faith in the ""pitchman"" to drive the price higher.  

Even analyst banks who are bullish on it have breakdowns in which they acknowledge that more than half of current valuation is derived from side businesses that won't even have any revenue until 2028 or later.  

I find it too tricky to play.  As much as I want to avoid going near anything their fraudulent founder touches, I believe that other people hired there are doing the actual work, doing the actual engineering, running the actual business, and those people likely make up for his deficiencies.  I do wonder if he ever found the right treatment to stop acting how he is, and if they hired a cool designer, and then launched some truly marketable new generations of their vehicles, they could take some market share as an automaker.

So that’s:
2020: 500,000
2021: 750,000
2022: 1,125,000
2023: 1,687,500
2024: 2,531,250
2025: 3,796,875

So 2020/2021 was the middle of Model 3/Y major ramp period. In 2023, guidance was for 1.8 million, which is well ahead of the 1.69 million necessary to keep with the long term. 50% CAGR target. They appear to be on course to get pretty close to the 1.8 million mark for 2023.

However, bringing production online is always stair steps. And 2024 may not meet the 2.5 million mark to keep the long term target, as the next gen vehicle plant won’t be online quick enough to make a significant contribution for that. Originally, they were going to build their next gen vehicle in Mexico, but they decided to expand their Austin factory instead and Mexico would come later.

As it stands, they have roughly 650,000 capacity in Fremont, 1.1 million in Shanghai, 250,000 in Berlin, and 175,000 in Austin. So their current capacity is near 2.2 million. They are expanding both Berlin and Austin, so they have a shot at being able to produce 2.5 million in 2024. The factory footprint is there for expanding Austin to 500,000 (Model Y + Cybertruck) but it is unlikely they will be able to scale up to all of that for 2024, but may hit that as a run rate at the end of 2024.

So YoY, they are probably looking at 30-35% growth with a shot at higher, with next gen coming online at end of 2024 or in 2025. For their long term target, they may come in about 10-15% shy of their long term 2024 target. For 2025/2026, they should have the next big step up in production capacity to hit or exceed their long term CAGR guidance.",1

17vfy74,"TSLA claims ""We're in-between growth waves"", stock up 6%","Tesla lost plenty of money while they were ramping up production as well.  While I agree that Tesla will almost certainly run the other EV-only carmakers out of business, the legacy automakers have a profitable ICE business to subsidize their losses until they get to full production.

Looking at traditional car sites, like Car & Driver, Teslas are already ranked in the mid to back of the pack of their categories.  Traditional car drivers seem unlikely to shift in masse to Teslas, which drive significantly different than an ICE car; they are favoring the legacy carmakers that give a more traditional driving experience with their EVs.

Tesla seems to be settling in as a niche carmaker.  They will have a relatively small share of drivers, but those will be loyal customers.  Eventually, their stock will be valued at the value of its future cash flows.  To me, this seems like it will be a number a little less than the current $700B - not enough to justify a short position, but a not a buy either.",-6

There's a lot of activity on site in terms of equipment installation for new production lines.

Installed line capacity today at Giga Texas is 250,000 Model Y/year and 125,000 Cybertruck/year.  That is only a fraction of what I believe will be the ultimate production volume of somewhere between 1-2 million vehicles/year at the site",3

People are switching to EVs at an incremental rate, people who try Teslas usually stay with Tesla (at least for now), as the other guy said, keep in mind most Tesla haters are just ideologically compromised, they hate Tesla because it's managed by Elon and that's all there is to it.

Right now there's no real Tesla competitors, it's all meme companies that lose billions, or big automakers losing billions, or some Chinese subsidized company that isn't really profitable but hey they got CCP backing so w/e.",12
17vfy74,"TSLA claims ""We're in-between growth waves"", stock up 6%","A lot of what you wrote shows how misinformed you are about the auto market and the EV transition. Just off the top of my head:

* ICE profits won't last. Eventually 100% of the cars sold will be EV's, no one, not even the traditional automakers are pretending otherwise on this.

* The problem for the traditional automakers is that the EV transition isn't going to go in a straight line, it's been going in an exponential S-curve. While EV adoption had a slower start in the US by comparison, you can look ahead at other regions like Europe and China to see how it's going to turn out in the US sooner or later. 

* Point being, consumer sentiment WILL shift in favor of EV's in much larger numbers sooner or later, and if traditional automakers aren't ready then they're going to feel a lot of pain as their ICE sales tank, especially if they can't produce and sell enough EV's to counter-act those ICE losses.

* The other problem with the above points is that it takes 3 years on average for a car to go from the idea/design phase to being brought to the market and put in the hands of consumers. So it's quite possible that traditional automakers will run out of time to make the transition and be screwed. This is already happening to a number of automakers in China where they aren't going to be allowed to sell some types of ICE vehicles very soon.

Bottom line, I don't see anyway around it, some automakers are going to go bankrupt because they fail to make the transition to EV's, or at the very least will need bailed out by the government. The fact that so many automakers are pushing the break on their shift to the EV transition lately is really going to screw them over in the next few years.",9

17vfy74,"TSLA claims ""We're in-between growth waves"", stock up 6%",">What exactly are the market advantages tesla has over other car companies? 

&#x200B;

(1) Software.  Compare Tesla's user interface to that of a Hyundai Ionic 5 or Volkswagen ID.4.  Tesla's interface is smoother and easier to use.  Tesla's control of their entire hardware platform and software stack, means they can more easily update their software.  Ford CEO Jim Farley explains the basic problem for other car companies:  [the software is all written by 150 different companies and they don’t talk to each other,  Even if I had a high-speed modem in the vehicle and I had the ability to write their software, it's actually their IP.](https://www.thedrive.com/news/ford-ceo-explains-why-legacy-automakers-take-forever-to-issue-ota-updates)

Ford is trying to bring this stuff back in-house, but it remains to be seen if they can recruit the talent necessary to do all the hardware and software themselves.  Volkswagen has thus far done a mediocre job of this (which in part [cost former VW CEO Herber Diess his own job](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/volkswagens-ceo-diess-leave-company-2022-07-22/))

&#x200B;

(2) Hardware.  Tesla has had entire teams devoted to developing custom silicon for its autonomous driving and AI projects.  Chips like HW3, HW4, and Dojo D1 give Tesla a big edge, as they can get the performance and efficiency specs they want, on the algorithms they plan to run.  

&#x200B;

(3) Economies of scale.  Tesla builds an order of magnitude more EVs for the U.S. market than its competitors: [https://www.evautoblog.com/news/tesla-model-3-and-y-still-dominating-u-s-ev-market-shows-data/](https://www.evautoblog.com/news/tesla-model-3-and-y-still-dominating-u-s-ev-market-shows-data/).  For example, they make about 10x more EVs than Ford.  With economies of scale, come cost benefits.  Competitors, except Chinese, are hurting:

* [Ford hits the brakes on $12 billion in EV spending because EVs are too expensive](https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/26/23934172/ford-12-billion-ev-investment-postpone-q3-earnings)
* [Honda CEO says firm is ending partnership with GM to develop affordable EVs](https://fortune.com/2023/10/25/honda-ceo-ending-partnership-gm-develop-affordable-evs-uaw-strike-automaker/)
* [Volkswagen to temporarily cut production of two EV models due to weaker demand](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/volkswagen-temporarily-pause-production-two-ev-car-models-due-drop-demand-2023-09-26/)

Note that Tesla continues to expand its economies of scale in the long run, by building its own lithium refining operations at Corpus Christi, TX, and continuing to scale up its in-house battery cell manufacturing capacity.  

&#x200B;

(4) Products beyond automotive

* Tesla sells stationary storage battery products (about a 6 Billion/year business from latest SEC filings), which is growing very rapidly and turns a profit at higher margins than cars.
* Future product pipeline includes AI training as a service (Dojo), and robots (Optimus android).  This is where Tesla's ability to attract top computer engineering and software engineering talent gives them a big edge.",15

Model 3 was/is a game changer, but a lot of people were already so convinced emotionally that Musk was an empty suit and EVs were a joke that they couldn't see what was coming.

Many bulls got so emotionally convinced that Musk was a genius that they excused multiple mistakes in 2022 and 2023, thinking Musk knew better than all the analysts on things like the unique and hard-to-make design of Cybertruck, and postponing new vehicle models in the belief FSD was coming any day and would make the need for more models obsolete.

That is just not true.

>ICE profits won't last. Eventually 100% of the cars sold will be EV's, no one, not even the traditional automakers are pretending otherwise on this.

That's nonsense.  ICE cars will be apart of the market for the foreseeable future, several decades at least.  There are significant parts of the market where EVs simply are not practical with current or foreseeable technology; it is just fantasy to think otherwise.

None of they legacy automakers have any plans to shut down there ICE production; you are simply making that up.

>The problem for the traditional automakers is that the EV transition isn't going to go in a straight line, it's been going in an exponential S-curve

No, that's just an absurd claim.  EV early adopters are already in the market.  The mass market is skeptical about EVs; many don't have easy access to charging, drive to much, or in isolated areas, to make charging practical.

Consumer demand is simply not there for a huge market shift in the near term.  Automakers are slowing their EV rollouts specifically for this reason.

>Point being, consumer sentiment WILL shift in favor of EV's in much larger numbers sooner or later, and if traditional automakers aren't ready then they're going to feel a lot of pain as their ICE sales tank, especially if they can't produce and sell enough EV's to counter-act those ICE losses.

ICE SUVs and trucks are where the consumer demand is.  It i going to be a long haul for EVs to chip away at that market share.  Consumers are already pushing back on increasing the EV mix, and forcing automakers to delay rollouts because of a lack of demand.  Your claim doesn't jibe with the reality in the market.

>The other problem with the above points is that it takes 3 years on average for a car to go from the idea/design phase to being brought to the market and put in the hands of consumers. So it's quite possible that traditional automakers will run out of time to make the transition and be screwed.

Again, it is absurd to think that mass market EV transition is going to be in the next 3 years; it will take several decades, and ICE vehicles are likely to still have a significant part of the market after that.

>China where they aren't going to be allowed to sell some types of ICE vehicles very soon

Government mandate like that won't fly in most of the US.  If the government feels the need to force consumers into a new technology, that is an indicator that the technology isn't ready for the mass market.  You are undermining your own argument here.

>I don't see anyway around it, some automakers are going to go bankrupt because they fail to make the transition to EV's

You need to look at the realities of the market.  ICE demand is strong, and the mass market is wary of EV tech.  You are just completely misreading the situation; just like most new tech, early adopters have jumped in, but it is going to be a long slog to get most of the market to transition.  We are talking decades here; not years.

They started 10 years too late and the market is already largely taken, they can't sell EVs for ridiculous prices because people won't get them since there's options.

> So you are pointing out that there are so many competitors that the market is splitting up between them. You are supporting my argument that Tesla is a niche player.

Last year Tesla's market share was 71%, very niche indeed, this year now that there's more competition (particularly in the high end market, which isn't as largely affected by the current economic context) you can actually buy from it's just 57%, then again they're also selling more than last year, the market just grew. By the way, depending on what model you want to get from them there might be waiting time, they literally can't keep up with demand. Meanwhile their competitors have their EVs sitting in a parking lot lol.

> That is just not true.

Their competitors are either inferior, don't really compete with them (selling a $300k EV Porsche that loses Porsche a fortune isn't exactly competition, they aim for a different kind of people) or are going at a massive loss that they won't be able to afford. Again, they won't be able to sell their just-came-out-from-R&D cars for $100k, they'll have to sell them for 1/5 of that, and that'll cost them too much.

> You ignored my point that actual reviews are out there; the Car & Driver ratings show that Teslas are near the back of the pack in every category of EV. You are ignoring what the market is saying; the facts prove you wrong.

Reviews are not trustworthy, especially when Tesla has pretty much all of the media against it. What matters is market share and market valuation, which strongly supports my argument. Tesla is worth more than every other trying-to-get-into-the-EV-market company combined, they sell almost twice as much as all of them combined, while having big future prospects in other areas.",2

Companies that don't build their own infotainment systems then pay licensing money to Apple and Google, and have no control over the overall experience of the system.  

Your take on the car electronic control systems is incorrect.  It is much slower to create and update software when the electronic control systems are made by dozens or even over 100 suppliers.  Did you read what the Ford CEO said?  Trying to integrate 150 pieces of software from systems created by other companies is difficult and time consuming.  

The number of car models released has nothing to do with Tesla's electronic controls architecture.  They all use a common computing system.  Their product lineup is the result of deliberate choices not to complicate manufacturing.

17j4q1u,We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),"Overall I think Tesla will come out just fine/ too early to be worried about Tesla.   Tesla is taking steps to prepare for lessening in demand due to inflation and interest rate increases.

They have basically no debt compare to the amount of cash they are holding. They are cash flow positive and they are continuing to build up the amount they are holding.

They are able to cut pricing aggressively to generate demand while still making money on each sale while their competitors are losing money on every EV.

On Cybertruck - it’s normal for any new product to take a while to make back the initial investment in new production lines, it was the case for all the previous models Tesla produced. It will likely be priced higher than the initial introduction due to inflation and with higher interest rate there will be an impact on demand. Given they are starting with the more expensive trim, it hard to tell how much of an impact there will be since people with higher income will be less affected by interest rate.

FSD - personally I use it on my drives and it’s worth it for the initial price I got it at 5k, 5 years ago. It’s been amazing to see the progress it has made. 
For people who drive a lot, I think it’s worth getting the subscription at the current state. I view FSD / AI as nice bonus, Tesla is not going to die in if they don’t figure it out in the near future.

The energy storage business is growing very fast and has high margins, it’ll be an area to watch for on how interest rate impacts the growth.",37
17j4q1u,We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),"I'll try to play devil's advocate and present you the thought process from a fund perspective. Whenever you're considering a play, the best thing to do is to first evaluate it in the context of its industry. You've gone very granular into the risks of Tesla, but haven't really presented it in the context versus competitors (i.e comparing TSLA's book metrics vs competitors, product cost/benefit vs competitors, etc). In other words, the first thing to ask yourself is are you actually truly bearish just Tesla or just bearish the entire auto/EV industry?

&nbsp;

From a buyside institutional perspective, the reason why that question above is so important is because when presenting a trade thesis, you have to consider not just idea generation, but also **idea execution.** 

&nbsp;

So this brings me to the next point: what if in the extreme case, I told you institutions were short every auto/EV (i.e industry short) and long TSLA over the five year span I mentioned? You mention that ""the 857% total return of Tesla is substantially higher than all of its peers, including Ford, Toyota, and Volkswagen."" What if I told you institutions holding TSLA are ""only"" up 100% total return in that span? Sure, there are going to be institutions that will only hold a long TSLA as representative bet on the industry, but by in large those will be the minority of funds.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


> Elon Musk has previously alluded to a poor performing EV market in the wake of a higher interest rate environment. Economic data confirms this narrative as Automobile shipments have declined substantially in Q3’ 2023.

&nbsp;

Here, you seem to hint at industry decline. So again, why would I worry specifically about Tesla and not the whole industry? Why would I not short the entire industry altogether? And this brings me to my ultimate point: from a very long term perspective, unless you have a negative view of EVs as a whole industry, the risk adjusted returns of a long TSLA and short the ""others"" pair trade is far preferable to taking idiosyncratic, or company specific, risk.",31

\- CT = niche product in a niche market (the US) for Americans that still want to buy something from EM

Better is the ennemy of good.

At this point in time BYD is globaly much better placed than Tesla.  The chinese (not BYD specific) are much further with their FSD.  BYD is even better vertically integrated.  And BYD knows marketing.  And above all: BYD has a small car that's globally available *now*

And once winter is here I don't use it all ... so pretty soon I won't even have a chance to test it until April 2024 when the snow melts and the road are clear.

Use machines for it?
You may as well go to store or vending machine.
In actuality vending machines are much more expensive than grocery stores as well.

They are not cheap but it's for convenience. 
Still rather go to grocery store then tp buy the food to be cheap unless time value.  If that's the case.

Make better vending machine food.
Japan already has it.  In usa if they make it they will cost 5x the cost of a grocery store and 2x the convince store.

The real cost is rent not labor remember that.  Owners Play the wages are too high when they never ever went up with inflation.  Really it's rent is too high.

If wages too high the employer can do it themselves they realize it's not worth it because wages too low.

There is a reason why employers won't do the same job employees do.  They see it as beneath them and pay isn't worththe amount if work being done meaning the wages are too low in The first place if it went to where it's worth it for employer to consider doing it themselves they would.

That's a fact.  So employers shut up and complain instead rent being too high.

The 4680 battery ramp is now a lot smoother and is trending in a very nice direction, the energy business margins are fantastic, you've got the cybertruck coming out at the end of this month. FSD is a matter of when not if.

Tesla is an EV solutions company that created their own demand and made their competition buy into their solutions.

The supercharger network is nothing short of amazing. Compare it to Electrify America and it's night and day.


Cybertruck is going to be a damper on profits for a bit, but I suspect the only reason it's going to be a dark horse for a bit is because it's coming out just as interest rates and auto loans jump up.

I dont think TSLA is in trouble at all right now. This isnt the first elon announcement and this isnt the first time a new product line has popped up creating doubt.

The model 3 almost killed the company, and then made it insanely profitable, then the Model Y dropped and practically printed money.

Tesla could either sell a lot more cars or license that self-driving tech to not only their own car buyers, but to other companies.

Some investors give them HUGE valuation because they think Tesla is way ahead on FSD due to the amount of data they collect.  Of course, that assumes other things are equal, which is rarely the case especially with things as complex as this.  IMO Tesla will not gain much if any actual advantage with FSD long-term, and so they essentially are primarily a car company and as such are vastly overvalued.",48

It mostly competes with other car manufacturers. Its peers are other car manufacturers. The only aspects of Tesla's business that seem to have no direct competition from other car manufacturers are the Powerwall and the Supercharger network.

I have personally never understood Tesla's valuation (many times the value of the rest of the auto sector put together). I expect a lot of retail investors will be left holding the bag as other car manufacturers continue to gobble up the startup tech they should've invested in 10 years ago, which will likely put them on better footing compared to Tesla in the long term.",16

Fair enough, but FSD is a large part of what makes Tesla a tech company. If it’s starting to fall behind on that…

Without that, they have their energy generation and storage solutions, which is a market I expect will get super competitive (that said, it already is competitive).",5
17j4q1u,We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),"> I worry that Elon overpromises and underdelivers

That is an important part of it.  But it is not the only part.

Tesla also has a powerful AI team.

Tesla also has money.

Tesla also has powerful hardware.

The data is particularly important, because that is something that is 100% required for this kind of AI, but the rest is also important.

I would be curious why you think that FSD would not change the valuation.  That seems like a very strange take.  Ultimately the valuation will be determined by how much fare a Robotaxi can charge.  The value of the FSD follows from that.",2
17j4q1u,We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),"It's my understanding that multiple companies are ahead of Tesla on FSD technology, Tesla is actually doing remarkably poorly considering how much free real world data they get from their users.

17j4q1u,We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),"> I believe that EVs will be beaten by hybrids in the market.

I don't understand how anyone could arrive at this conclusion. The entire reason that hybrids exist is to combat the mileage you get on an EV charge, but that's continuing to improve, and will eventually get to the point of being as long range as gas is. What reason would hybrids have to exist after that, other than to fuel (no pun intended) the oil industry?",13
17j4q1u,We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),"Nah hybrids will be banned too someday and are just a plaster on the wound, companys like toyota are super behind because they bet on hybrids, also hybrids rely still heavy on gas nd i think people wanna move away from the flactuation in fossile fuels",17
17j4q1u,We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),"It's enterprise value is so much higher than its competitors because its market cap is so much higher than its competitors. When you're talking using any metric involving market cap, you're really comparing market value of a company and not book value.

&nbsp;

I have absolutely no view on Tesla or the EV market, but why not also first compare metrics that aren't affected by public sentiment (like market cap or enterprise value are). At the simplest level compared to its competitors (thus far, and not speaking about the future), Tesla's profit margins far, far outperform on a per vehicle basis as well as on a holistic company basis. How about its free cash flow? R&D spend vs competitors? Top and bottom line projected growth vs. competitors?

&nbsp;

So the two ""company specific"" aspects to Tesla you've presented as negative catalysts, FSD and Cybertruck, are interesting. FSD is truly company specific to Tesla, but Cybertruck is not really. What I mean by this is that auto/EV makers (which is Tesla's main industry) all have the same risks from this categorical new product launch (i.e GM with EV Hummer for instance, Rivian etc). As far as I'm aware, none of the major competitors to Tesla of them have the risks that FSD presents. So if you're going to make a play on Tesla and **NOT** the industry, this would be the area of focus.",6

17j4q1u,We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),">I guess I believe that EVs will be beaten by hybrids in the market.

That has already turned out not to be true. And especially with cheaper and cheaper EVs, there will be no room for hybrids.

It's like saying that iPhone-like smartphones, only with a kind of hybrid model with a physical keyboard would win. But pure smartphones are objectively superior, just like EVs are objectively superior to hybrids.",1

This for example is simply laughable:
> Musk still sees demand surpassing one million units. However, it seems unlikely that demand will be that high

It's based on absolutely nothing tangible. 1M units is the low-ball of the century when talking about Cybertruck. They have 2M pre-orders, and 99% of the market hasn't even seriously looked at the product. I'd be surprised if they end up doing less than 200K a year, probably closer to 500K when fully ramped. It'll probably sell millions over it's lifetime. And that's just in the US.

EVs are net-negative energy-wise at the national and global level.  There are energy losses involved with charging and sitting idle that are just wasting energy that could otherwise be used elsewhere.  The only reason these cars are cheaper to operate is they are subsidized thru tax credits and lower excise taxes.  That will eventually go away and operating costs will skyrocket.

EVs are also propped up by the climate change fictions.  At some point that will be unsustainable too.  The warning sign there will be a shift in R&D and academia toward some other large technology cash cow massive project they can use as a revenue stream for their industry.  Nuclear gen IV and asteroid defense are too specialized.

This is the most illogical argument you can think of. Even if 0% of those reservations convert, they can still sell millions of Cybertrucks. 99.9% of cars sold are just people buying a car long after it first hit the market. So even if 20% of those reservations convert (I personally think it'll be somewhere between 20% and 50%), that's 3+ years of production sold out, while 99.9% of sales will start after those reservations are delivered.

You misread that letter. Tesla has no intend of going above Level 2 until they solve full autonomy, as it's an unnecessary distraction. Nowhere is it written that you need a level 3 or 4 system to be able to build a fully autonomous car. It's just arbitrary benchmarks.

Unclear.  If dealing with the remaining edge cases were as simple as just solving them, then I would say Tesla is very near.  But AI does not work like that.  They have to solve the edge cases without screwing up the stuff that already works well.  And that is where we get into ultra-cutting-edge technology that nobody can predict well.  

The fact that Tesla has moved from heuristics to a fully end-to-end system should improve progress.  But unless you work for Tesla's AI team, I doubt you can shine much light on this.  

Ultimately it comes down to how much you believe in Tesla's AI team.

This is untrue.

I've been a TSLA shareholder since 2011, and was a participating member at Tesla Motors Club investor forums for much of the 2010s.  

Many of Tesla's largest, long-term retail investors (some with 400,000 to 500,000 or more TSLA shares) have significant professional expertise in engineering, computer science, and business.  It was that expertise that led many to conclude that the conventional wisdom about Tesla was incorrect.  

The unsophisticated investors who maybe buy a few shares on their Robinhood accounts, don't have the financial firepower to prop up a 700 Billion market cap.  

Looking at TSLA trading volume alone, an average of about 115 million shares traded daily over the past month, according to Yahoo Finance, that amounts to 10s of Billions of $ worth of shares trading hands every day.   This is not something that small retail can have much effect on.",4

Now you are moving the goal posts. If the Cybertruck is on the market for years it can obviously reach a million units. The argument was about immediate demand. This is important for valuation models that drive the price of the stock price due to TVM. My argument is perfectly logical when valuing the company... I would assume you are not a finance person, so your ignorance is tolerable.

""You do not need a level 3 or 4 system to build an autonomous car""

This is a self-contradicting statement. An autonomous car is a level 3+ system. Why is Tesla not testing any of these systems? Maybe because they are not close... Meanwhile Waymo and Mobileye have Level 4 systems with no one in the driver seat. You are essentially saying that Tesla should not focus on real autonomous driving and instead focus on gimmicks.

For anyone new out there like you, rides without critical disengagements need to be substantially higher than 94% to be safe. Tesla's safety is worse than drunk drivers. So they fail the first test. The second test is rides without disengagements which measures the actual effectiveness of a system. Tesla is around 30-40% which is abysmal.

I have been following Waymo's progress for a long time and I think they're already 90% of the way there, and Alphabet has basically infinite resources to improve the technology to the point of commercialization. They are fenced into SF right now but that's mostly for regulatory reasons, which if we're honest is probably a good chunk of the reason that Tesla is still only rated for level 2. I don't think level 5 will be achieved anytime soon, and as you say it comes down to solving edge cases. Waymo is already mostly there as far as I am concerned, where the car can drive on its own in a variety of conditions for extended periods of time. For the foreseeable future, there are and still will be edge case scenarios where the car needs to pull over and ask for human input. Progress is all about minimizing the number of times that it happens.

The big problem that I have with Tesla is that they break ethics, rules and regulations at every turn. They basically gave a level 2 system over to the public and marketed it as a level 4 system. They have less safeties in place so the car is more likely to just keep going and blame the driver for not taking over and avoiding the accident when something inevitably goes wrong. It has given FSD a bad name with serious crashes and fatalities, and they have worked harder to cover up any blame that Tesla might have for these incidents than they have spent investigating to find out what went wrong and how to fix it.

I believe your take is false, because while anyone can buy stock in a company, making an informed decision every day for 10+ years to continue holding that stock, does involve some degree of skill and research.  

I've been continuously weighing different factors of Tesla's business since 2011.  That means knowing the members of the leadership team, knowing the products and product pipeline, knowing the various industries Tesla operates in, reading the SEC filings, and much more. 

Many people sold their TSLA shares in a panic during various points like early 2016 and early 2019.  I continued to hold because my research indicated that the panics were unjustified and due to transitory factors.

They were on the verge of bankruptcy for almost all of the 2010s.  I kept a very close eye on their cash burn rate, ability to raise capital, their debts (10+ Billion at the peak), and the interest rate and maturity date of those debts.  Most or even all of this is/was publicly available in the 10-Q and 10-K filings.

> Tesla ending up as it is today is luck. 

**Nothing is all luck or all skill.**

Yes, there was some element of luck to TSLA.

If a random big earthquake had destroyed Tesla's Fremont factory at some point in the mid-2010s, Tesla probably would've gone bankrupt.  That would have been bad luck.  And it wouldn't have been unprecedented either -- the 2011 Tsunami, caused by an earthquake, severely disrupted Japanese automotive production.

If Russia had assassinated Elon Musk in the 2010s in an attempt to slow SpaceX, that would probably have led to Tesla going bankrupt during 2017-2018 ""production hell"".  That would have been bad luck too.

During this 5 year period tesla has delivered an impressive amount of growth there's no doubt. But i think you're ignoring the clear decline in growth that the previous 3 quarters have shown. EPS Q4 2022 1.13, Q1 2023 0.85, Q2 2023 0.91, Q3 0.62. You're looking into the past assuming that a growth stock will continue to grow at the same rate as it has done in the past but that is never the case and as an investment stategy is speculative at best.

After a period of sharp exponential growth there usually follows a flattening of growth, and the evidence of the past quarters is showing we are nearing that stage.

You're also ignoring the CEO's own prediction that income will decline due to increased competition and high inflation rates worldwide and the fact they have slashed prices on their cars to gain market share but cutting their own profit margin on sale which will inevitably have a negative effect on their earnings compared to 2022 and 2021.",1

That is not entirely true, and also misses the bigger picture.

Tesla was setting up the initial production line for Model S in 2011.  The company had bought [what is now the Tesla Factory at Fremont](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Fremont_Factory) from Toyota in 2010, after Toyota and GM shut down the NUMMI joint venture they'd previously operated there.  

The broader picture you miss is that Tesla in 2011 had a lot of talent.  The efforts of talented people are more important in a startup than the factory.  It's the talent that brings the organization to life.

Tesla's leadership team in 2011 was excellent: CTO J.B. Straubel, Model S program director Jerome Guillen (hired from Daimler), manufacturing operations executive Gilbert Passin (hired from Toyota), VP of business development Diarmuid O'Connell, VP of worldwide retail George Blankenship (former Apple exec who had developed Apple stores), and probably several others I'm forgetting at the moment.  CEO Elon Musk, as controversial as he is today, had put together a star management team.  These people were worth investing in.

No, this is called taking a calculated risk.  

My purchases of TSLA stock over the past 12 years represent only a small % of the total money I used to buy investments.  

I've ploughed the vast majority of my savings since 1997 into boring index funds and ETFs like SPY.  

If TSLA had gone bankrupt in 2013 or 2019, my daily finances and long-term retirement plans would have been unaffected.",2
