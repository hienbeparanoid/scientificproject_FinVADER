2. Jack Ma walked back his stock sale after the criticism and downward trend of BABA.
3. BABA still leads with Alipay, yes the retail aspect is losing market share. Do note that these other companies are offering discounts after discounts to get market share. Once the discounts are gone how can you undercut BABA?
4. BABA as a whole might not be around 5 years later, but the payment system is hard to beat in China when digital wallets are the normal. BABA allows you to use foreign account digitally to pay when in China. The Chinese do not jump ship that easily, hence why Apple Pay is not super popular in China. Alipay has a Google like effect in China and has more room to run. 
5. Jack Ma will not let his company fail, he’s acting in the shadows for his family’s safety. He’s still calling the shots at BABA and biding his time.
6. BABA is a hold until after 2027 when the next election occurs .",2

2) It’s hard to see how the dividend yield of less than 2% for the Chinese-based company is going to attract income investors when they have much better risk-free alternatives closer to home.
3) At the same time, the buyback program has been ongoing since 2021, but that didn’t stop the shares from depreciating even more. 
4) The founder Jack Ma is leaving Alibaba
5) The negative market reaction to Alibaba’s latest earnings results indicates that the new geopolitical reality with heightened macro risks will continue to be more important for investors than the company’s fundamentals. What’s more, is that it appears that there’s nothing that the company’s management can do to change the situation.

Because of that, investors are scared, and the price of BABA has been driving down, down, down. It reached a point that I think is nearish to the bottom, (could go down to ~60, though) and I want to see what the next 5 years brings when the world inevitably makes amends (or goes to war) and makes it work like we usually do.

Okay. You are saying Twitter turned a profit for a couple of years and not others because of legal troubles. This was during the biggest economic boom in recent memory. 0% ffr, everyone trapped in their houses increasing Internet usage, and lots of helicopter money. Now it's been a year and the script has flipped. We have a 5% ffr and economic conditions are restrictive. What kind of quarterly loss are they taking right now? 

>His other companies are successful because they've attracted great talent and then built up a layer of management to manage Elon - run with his good ideas and ignore his bad ideas. 

This could very well be true. I don't work directly for him so I have no idea. That said, whatever methodology he uses, it's been extremely successful. 


>He is like a virus, and those companies had time to grow an immune response to him.

Don't think this is a fair statement.  Virus implies he is net negative. If that was the case and companies were being successful despite him damaging, then ceo would be a meaningless position. Why aren't other companies pulling Jon Does off the street to build trillion dollar companies... Why is it that whenever he gets involved, amazing companies are built...

>At Twitter, he fired all of the experts and he's just flailing around digging the hole deeper.

You mean he cut all the fat and brought out his own software people to review the product? Did he cut to much initially? Yes. Was this type of change needed for success? Also yes. The company was hemorrhaging money. 


At the end of the day, I'm very happy that he was willing to take the platform over. He has provided a town square that might not be perfect, but is far better than anything else around. You should be concerned that the government was actively suppressing free speech, sometimes even actively deceiving the public to hide true information.

So, 1 billion per model over a 2 - 5 year cycle, all the while your margins are getting lower / sales reduce. That's a lot of time and money Tesla will have to invest and they have run out of early adopters.

175fio1,"Hello, please look at my Tsla and nvda calls, they are way above strike but worth almost nothing, why is that?","I only read a few comments so in case you haven’t figured it out yet or gotten the answer:

You are buying the right to execute a contract that says you can buy 100 shares of TSLA at $260. You want to do this because you think the price of the stock itself will go up but since you are buying the contract ahead of time, there’s always the possibility that you’ll be right. That possibility is called time value and since the person selling you the contract is in it to make money, they are gonna charge you for that time value. 
So you are buying the contract with real money and the contract is priced based on how likely the market thinks it is that TSLA will go up in price and by how much. 
The price you pay for the contract is not the actual purchase of any stock, and when it comes time to buy the stock, the cost to do that is completely different than the cost of the contract. You don’t HAVE to execute the contract and purchase the 100 shares of TSLA per contract, but if it goes up in price, you want to. You DO however have to pay for that contract (upfront) and you never get that money back. What that means, is that if you want to make money by buying an option, the stock price has to go up enough to outweigh the cost of buying at the set contract (strike) price. Here is an example or two:
Profit) 1 TSLA $260 strike call. Contract cost $80. TSLA stock goes to $265. On expiration, you execute the option to buy 100 shares at $260 and immediately sell them at $265. $500 profit minus the $80 for the contract = $420 profit (nice)

Break even) 1 TSLA $260 strike call. Contract cost $80. TSLA stock goes to $260.80. You can execute, buy the 100 shares at $260, and immediately sell at $260.80 for an $80 profit but you know where I’m going with this. The profit is eaten by the initial cost and you walk away unscathed. (Note that even if the stock price only got as high as $260.70, it would still be worth executing because your losses would then only be $10

Loss) 1 TSLA $260 strike call. Contract cost $80. You messed up and bought the option on the same day as I bought TSLA stock so of course TSLA crashed. At expiration, the stock price is $230. You don’t want to execute, because you would have to buy at $260 and then what? You could just buy them without a contract now for $230. 

Cost per option contract divided by 100 plus strike price = your break-even point.

Note that you can also make money with options by buying them, holding them until the stock price goes up signaling good things to come (increase in time value) and then sell the contract for a profit. This is dangerous because time value decreases with each passing hour and day. 

Profits are unlimited on calls, losses are limited to the amount you paid for the contract(s)
The opposite is true for puts. Unlimited losses. Don’t do this.

Hope this is helpful and good luck!",1

175fio1,"Hello, please look at my Tsla and nvda calls, they are way above strike but worth almost nothing, why is that?","Check the options Delta. Delta measures how much the option's price will react to changes in the price of the underlying share. Delta goes from 0 to 100, 100 meaning that 1 dollar move in the underlying will translate to 1 dollar price move in the option, delta of 50 = 1$ move in the underlying moves the option 0.5$ and so on. Delta can also be seen as rough estimate (in %) of the option expiring in the money. Delta will rise in the money and fall out of the money. These changes in delta are called gamma. The less time to expiration, the higher is your gamma (unless you're deep in or out the money). Gamma has a flip side though, it comes with theta - i.e. time value depreciation. The higher your gamma, the higher your theta. Unless you go for smah & grab trades, i would roll the option 1m before expiry to the next, as theta will eat a higher portion of your extrinsic value the closer you get to expiry. (Imagine 20 days left, each day costs you 5%. Only 3 days left, each day costs you 33%) And then there's vega, that's how your option reacts to changes in implied volatility. This is especially relevant for in & at the money options with some duration. The higher the implied volatility, the more expensive option, the larger the move required to actually make money from buying the option. You may also wanna look into spreads, e.g. buying a call with a lower strike and selling one with a higher strike. Or buying a put with a higher strike and selling a put with a lower strike. Divide the difference between strikes by the difference in premium (that you pay on a net basis) to see your maximum return, e.g. 10$ strike diff / 2.5$ premium = you 4x your 'investment' when the option expires at or above your higher short call or at or below your lower put.",1
175fio1,"Hello, please look at my Tsla and nvda calls, they are way above strike but worth almost nothing, why is that?","Based on your comments - you aren't familiar with how buyers of call options price them. There are concepts of time decay and marginal profit that are at play here. For one - the breakeven on the calls you bought is as follows: Cost/100 + strike price. In essence, you have to cover the strike price and the derivative premium to be profitable. The share price being at or near the strike price is bad news with only a week or two left to create intrinsic value. There are lots of other factors to analyze for call options to determine their worth. Ultimately - I would recommend you do a lot of research on this area of the market before buying any more options.",1
175fio1,"Hello, please look at my Tsla and nvda calls, they are way above strike but worth almost nothing, why is that?",The real answer to your question is because premiums are expensive.

16b72u1,Mercedes unveils new electric concept cars with better range than any Tesla model. Puts on TSLA?!,"Better range isn’t some magical feature that car companies struggle to attain. It just comes down to adding more battery packs and running statistics on how that jump in price will affect sales.

Lucid also sells vehicles with significantly better range. They BOASTED about that range when unveiling the Air. It was so important that everyone knew a lucid had more range than a tesla. Except it means the car is 10 grand more expensive than it needs to be and they struggle to sell even half their inventory.

The market of people who need to drive 470 miles a day without ever stopping or having access to electricity overnight to charge is pretty minuscule. Most folks just prefer shorter range, a cheaper price tag, and more charging infrastructure- which is what Tesla offers",76

16b72u1,Mercedes unveils new electric concept cars with better range than any Tesla model. Puts on TSLA?!,That range estimate is useless info without knowing efficiency imo. Tesla can easily fit enough cells in their cars to match or even beat this 466 mile estimate if they really wanted to. The issue is for every extra cell you add it makes the car significantly heavier which makes it harder to maneuver and accelerate quickly while also reducing efficiency. This makes it a worse overall car unless going on road trips. Sure it’d be nice  to have extra range as an option for the Teslas but it would have to be significantly more costly for a car that will be inferior in many ways. Tesla has very few models and trims for the sake of production streamlining which has enabled them to grow faster than any car company ever.,1

Mercedes PHEV hybrids are currently priced about 10-15k higher than the ICE versions. That's for small battery PHEVs that are built on the same ICE platform (so they're cheap to make).  

Where I'm at, including incentives, the entry-level CLA PHEV is 42k (47k sticker price) while the new Model 3 begins at 32k.

16b72u1,Mercedes unveils new electric concept cars with better range than any Tesla model. Puts on TSLA?!,"Who are you crying for/protecting with this subliminally Pro Tesla persuasive essay?

The market of people requiring to drive a fully loaded vehicle with an overall lower GVWR (gross vehicle weight when fully loading an electric vehicle vs an ICE vehicle) is much much higher than you realize but you're either too inexperienced to see the whole market or again trying to persuade the reader with a very biased and delusional opinion of typical driver wants and needs.

Yes, more batteries equals more range depending how you decide to design an electric vehicle, there are enough spaces to install more batteries, change the vehicle weight vs towing capacity vs on board carrying capacity to the point that you're basically driving a battery on wheels... kind of defeats the purpose of having a truck,  or van, or semi truck whose only purpose is to deliver as much as possible and carry as heavy a load as possible within safety laws and regulations based on that vehicles GVWR.

Your opinion completely ignores professional movers, delivery, taxi, logistics in general. It leaves out the fact that developing a different battery that is lighter in weight and offers a more dense charge and thus more range at less weight so a delivery driver can continue their long, strenuous route that may require more range due to heavier towing loads requiring more from the vehicle both ICE or electric,  heavy loaded vehicles towing or even a passenger filled electric car driving long distance may not make it the full ""estimated"" distance, may not even come close with Tesla currently being sued and investigated for faking range numbers among various other issues they're having both legally and transparently.

Mercedes also is delivering a realistic electric semi truck at a realistic price based on current competition in the ev sector, I mean be real Tesla and Elon Musk sort of created a little monopoly on the vision of electric cars and with the help of people like you down playing just how complicated the entire production of electric vehicles really is, from how much it costs to build a fleet of long range electric trucks capable of performing at the same level as their ICE similarly weighted and sized counterparts (Ford Lightning vs Fords other trucks of similar weight and size probably offer insanely different HP and torque packages for example), to what it takes to make batteries and gather raw materials ethically.

Tesla hasn't been able to do much more than use billions of dollars in tax paid subsidies and investors like Saudi Arabia to build a gigafactory all over the world and then promote China as being better workers than everyone else while continuing to reap the rebates the US offers Tesla drivers. 

It's a sad joke in the end who to purchase from because you're now being forced to make an ethical consumer decision on top of whether you're spending $10k more or not on a car that is the future. 400 + range and batteries not made from child labor harvesting the raw metals to begin with is all I want so I can drive a fully loaded vehicle up Ike's Gauntlet and then some and feel fine as a daisy in the summertime.

Mercedes saying they are delivering on that is a big enough reason for investors and countries to switch over from Teslas Monopoly and Elon Musks actual neo Nazi agenda vs Mercedes old German agenda lol. It's all a joke man.",0

Get it?",-1
16b72u1,Mercedes unveils new electric concept cars with better range than any Tesla model. Puts on TSLA?!,"1st some introduction to German politics, German law does not allow full autonomous driving, so the whole argument goes out the door. Mercedes has the sensors and some of the systems to enable such ideas but it's fair to say it is a long shot to have Mercedes roll out full autonomy tomorrow even if it were allowed.
2nd Mercedes focus the past decade has been on assisted driving, things like lane keeping assist, parking aid, highway cruise control so on and so forth. Through that Mercedes had a large focus on near proximity data and sensors, there is a reason why every drive assistant in modern cars will not go a significantly higher speed than 130 km/h, that's because the faster the vehicle is the further down the road the car has so analyse to make good decisions, the complications grow exponentially with increasing speed and Mercedes had a lot of catching up to do when Tesla first rolled out their version of drive assist because Mercedes focused way havier on the comfort applications of drive assist like parking and lane keeping. 
3rd criticism where criticism is due, Tesla is far away from perfect and some claims made by them are way out of proportion. On the other hand Mercedes has also had their fair share of trouble with driving assist (reminder to Mercedes first iteration of emergency breaking ...) Which led to countless accidents and vehicles called back to the dealership to update the software. Tesla should never have claimed autonomous driving capabilities no question on that front, in contrast it has become quite obvious that Tesla had some sever flaws as well as some oversights on their part eg. not utilizing lidar Sensor. 
All in all it's incorrect of either company to claim autonomous driving capabilities because both have had problems with their programs and as sophisticated as these systems are they can only recognize a situation that has occurred beforehand or they were programmed to deal with. That's also the point where both companies have already experienced turmoil, when their vehicles encounter situations that are not judgable or misinterpreted.",1
16b72u1,Mercedes unveils new electric concept cars with better range than any Tesla model. Puts on TSLA?!,"If Tesla is priced lower it competes for sure. Which is why they are dropping their prices.

16b72u1,Mercedes unveils new electric concept cars with better range than any Tesla model. Puts on TSLA?!,"being priced the same doesn’t matter when you have to buy it through a dealer, there’s no guarantee Mercedes can keep up with demand, and there’s no charging network like Tesla’s Superchargers. Tesla is also rolling out an autopilot system trained on a supercomputer that no auto company would ever be able to build for the next decade.

The current mercedes electric vehicles are also riddled with problems and have been recalled multiple times due to software and hardware issues. No guarantee that this won’t have those problems either. I’d buy a BMW, Audi, or Porsche over Mercedes, even if there’s a slightly higher premium.",6

16b72u1,Mercedes unveils new electric concept cars with better range than any Tesla model. Puts on TSLA?!,"Well, there is an argument to be made that Mercedes is no longer really a luxury brand, or other brands are catching on fast to the luxury style of Mercedes therefore taking their competitive edge. In recent years bmw is increasingly moving away from sports/ performance cars towards more and more luxury cars, like limousine style vehicles and their SUV line up. Bmw actually introduced some new color and materials in their line up with a finish that rivals Mercedes. 
On the other hand Tesla's cars especially on the higher end of the budget are also quite renounced nowadays - the model X and model Y are both huge cars rivaling the spaciousness of a GLE and the model S is comparable in dimensions to an amg bi turbo V8 sports coupé, might even be bigger. Now of course everyone always says ""but the build quality???"" And yes Tesla is not spending the same amount of money on the inside of the car as Mercedes is but a Mercedes with comparable stats dimension wise usually already runs you to at least 1.5 times the price and is the slight quality improvement on the inside really worth that amount of money ? And one could add that performance wise the race is not even close, Teslas do not have the best suspension granted but the handling of the cars are second to none, a model Y drives like an amg gt because of its low center of gravity, the electric motors enable an acceleration that is not comparable to combustion engines or any electric car Mercedes has on the road. The model S steps that performance gain up a notch and is really only rivaled by something like the rimac nevera (an electric hyper sports car that costs 20x the price of a model S). Tesla is still in a place where it rivals traditional car manufacturers. And Mercedes is really not as special on luxury in modern times among the ever increasing standards of quality and prestige in the car world, at least not as special as they used to be.",1

I didn't really base my comment on Reddit communities as much as on irl experience and you're right in that most of my friends are more left-leaning students. I'm aware that this isn't a cross-section of the general public.

However my partner's father is quite wealthy and through him I've talked to a lot of really well-off people, and I can assure you besides one person that owns a software company none of them would ever buy a Tesla, exactly for that reason. It's not that they're left-leaning, it's just that they don't like the image Tesla has and would instead buy a Taycan every day of the week if it has to be electric.

Obviously a Porsche is more expensive and not an option for a lot of Tesla buyers, but that's exactly where I believe Mercedes will come in. If it holds true, it's giving another good option in a price segment that was lacking in competition.",1

>They even admit this today saying they are ""in-between growth waves"". **What does that mean.** When will the next mega growth wave be that justifies the insane market cap? 

It means that Tesla is in the process of building out new production lines that will enable faster growth in 2-3 years.

* Gigafactory Texas (just outside of Austin) is a huge building but still mostly empty.  Tesla has been installing a production line for Cybertruck, and appears to be building production  capacity for its next-generation vehicle (NGV), based on equipment being moved inside.  You can find plenty of drone flyover videos on YouTube.  I recommend Joe Tegtmeyer's channel for regular updates.  
* Gigafactory Berlin has enough newly cleared land area to triple in size
* Tesla is building a lithium refinery at Corpus Christi, Texas, to ensure lithium supply to both its Texas campus and future Mexico campus

&#x200B;

There's a lot going on at Tesla in terms of building infrastructure for the next-generation of vehicles around 2025.  

There's also a lot of work being done on the AI and robotics side of things, particularly with regard to development of custom silicon, AI training, and custom robotics hardware.",28

Tesla has pricing power to drive demand when needed. The only people who seem to deny this are those who are ideologically compromised and cannot make an honest judgement on Tesla as a company because they are clouded by their opinions on Elon. People should be very cautious about making investments, shorts or going long, on any stock they have emotional investment into, you need to hold a cold detached opinion.

Ford announced its nine month EBIT loss in the EV segment to be 3.1 billion ( https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/ford-withdraws-2023-forecast-warns-ev-results-2023-10-26/#:~:text=Ford%20said%20its%20EV%20unit,the%20Ford%20Model%20e%20unit.) this is just one example.

You can't take TSLA out of all the ETF's/bundles/mutual funds. So buying pressure flows naturally. Esp with pensions buying SP500 companies. It's like trying to stop water coming out from a hose. Sometimes the hose shuts off, but usually the best advice is to not time the market, which means that you should always be buying to get the best cost-basis.

Steve Eisner, short on Tesla over 5-6 years, is currently short again and says he will remain so until $100 or less, and that it's headed to $50.  

Jim Cramer openly says he ignores the fundamentals, pinches his nose, and has faith in the ""pitchman"" to drive the price higher.  

Even analyst banks who are bullish on it have breakdowns in which they acknowledge that more than half of current valuation is derived from side businesses that won't even have any revenue until 2028 or later.  

I find it too tricky to play.  As much as I want to avoid going near anything their fraudulent founder touches, I believe that other people hired there are doing the actual work, doing the actual engineering, running the actual business, and those people likely make up for his deficiencies.  I do wonder if he ever found the right treatment to stop acting how he is, and if they hired a cool designer, and then launched some truly marketable new generations of their vehicles, they could take some market share as an automaker.  Probably the best thing that could ever happen to tesla the company would be if Musk moved to Mars, found a different pursuit, whatever.",-2

Now at 240 and could break through next resistance. 
In the last 2 weeks it’s moved up $35. (A lot of opportunity for going there and making some good cash). 

Best things atm are to wait around the 200-210 range and then go long for a few weeks. Anything under 200 atm bounces back up. Just observations when looking at scalping the share price. 
Now at 240 it’s a wait and see as could move up towards the 260-270 range or move down to the 200’s.

17vfy74,"TSLA claims ""We're in-between growth waves"", stock up 6%","Original long term guidance was for 50% CAGR indexed from 2020, going through 2030.

So that’s:
2020: 500,000
2021: 750,000
2022: 1,125,000
2023: 1,687,500
2024: 2,531,250
2025: 3,796,875

So 2020/2021 was the middle of Model 3/Y major ramp period. In 2023, guidance was for 1.8 million, which is well ahead of the 1.69 million necessary to keep with the long term. 50% CAGR target. They appear to be on course to get pretty close to the 1.8 million mark for 2023.

However, bringing production online is always stair steps. And 2024 may not meet the 2.5 million mark to keep the long term target, as the next gen vehicle plant won’t be online quick enough to make a significant contribution for that. Originally, they were going to build their next gen vehicle in Mexico, but they decided to expand their Austin factory instead and Mexico would come later.

As it stands, they have roughly 650,000 capacity in Fremont, 1.1 million in Shanghai, 250,000 in Berlin, and 175,000 in Austin. So their current capacity is near 2.2 million. They are expanding both Berlin and Austin, so they have a shot at being able to produce 2.5 million in 2024. The factory footprint is there for expanding Austin to 500,000 (Model Y + Cybertruck) but it is unlikely they will be able to scale up to all of that for 2024, but may hit that as a run rate at the end of 2024.

So YoY, they are probably looking at 30-35% growth with a shot at higher, with next gen coming online at end of 2024 or in 2025. For their long term target, they may come in about 10-15% shy of their long term 2024 target. For 2025/2026, they should have the next big step up in production capacity to hit or exceed their long term CAGR guidance.",1

17vfy74,"TSLA claims ""We're in-between growth waves"", stock up 6%","Tesla lost plenty of money while they were ramping up production as well.  While I agree that Tesla will almost certainly run the other EV-only carmakers out of business, the legacy automakers have a profitable ICE business to subsidize their losses until they get to full production.

Looking at traditional car sites, like Car & Driver, Teslas are already ranked in the mid to back of the pack of their categories.  Traditional car drivers seem unlikely to shift in masse to Teslas, which drive significantly different than an ICE car; they are favoring the legacy carmakers that give a more traditional driving experience with their EVs.

Tesla seems to be settling in as a niche carmaker.  They will have a relatively small share of drivers, but those will be loyal customers.  Eventually, their stock will be valued at the value of its future cash flows.  To me, this seems like it will be a number a little less than the current $700B - not enough to justify a short position, but a not a buy either.",-6

17vfy74,"TSLA claims ""We're in-between growth waves"", stock up 6%","A lot of what you wrote shows how misinformed you are about the auto market and the EV transition. Just off the top of my head:

* ICE profits won't last. Eventually 100% of the cars sold will be EV's, no one, not even the traditional automakers are pretending otherwise on this.

* The problem for the traditional automakers is that the EV transition isn't going to go in a straight line, it's been going in an exponential S-curve. While EV adoption had a slower start in the US by comparison, you can look ahead at other regions like Europe and China to see how it's going to turn out in the US sooner or later. 

* Point being, consumer sentiment WILL shift in favor of EV's in much larger numbers sooner or later, and if traditional automakers aren't ready then they're going to feel a lot of pain as their ICE sales tank, especially if they can't produce and sell enough EV's to counter-act those ICE losses.

* The other problem with the above points is that it takes 3 years on average for a car to go from the idea/design phase to being brought to the market and put in the hands of consumers. So it's quite possible that traditional automakers will run out of time to make the transition and be screwed. This is already happening to a number of automakers in China where they aren't going to be allowed to sell some types of ICE vehicles very soon.

Bottom line, I don't see anyway around it, some automakers are going to go bankrupt because they fail to make the transition to EV's, or at the very least will need bailed out by the government. The fact that so many automakers are pushing the break on their shift to the EV transition lately is really going to screw them over in the next few years.",9

17vfy74,"TSLA claims ""We're in-between growth waves"", stock up 6%",">What exactly are the market advantages tesla has over other car companies? 

&#x200B;

(1) Software.  Compare Tesla's user interface to that of a Hyundai Ionic 5 or Volkswagen ID.4.  Tesla's interface is smoother and easier to use.  Tesla's control of their entire hardware platform and software stack, means they can more easily update their software.  Ford CEO Jim Farley explains the basic problem for other car companies:  [the software is all written by 150 different companies and they don’t talk to each other,  Even if I had a high-speed modem in the vehicle and I had the ability to write their software, it's actually their IP.](https://www.thedrive.com/news/ford-ceo-explains-why-legacy-automakers-take-forever-to-issue-ota-updates)

Ford is trying to bring this stuff back in-house, but it remains to be seen if they can recruit the talent necessary to do all the hardware and software themselves.  Volkswagen has thus far done a mediocre job of this (which in part [cost former VW CEO Herber Diess his own job](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/volkswagens-ceo-diess-leave-company-2022-07-22/))

&#x200B;

(2) Hardware.  Tesla has had entire teams devoted to developing custom silicon for its autonomous driving and AI projects.  Chips like HW3, HW4, and Dojo D1 give Tesla a big edge, as they can get the performance and efficiency specs they want, on the algorithms they plan to run.  

&#x200B;

(3) Economies of scale.  Tesla builds an order of magnitude more EVs for the U.S. market than its competitors: [https://www.evautoblog.com/news/tesla-model-3-and-y-still-dominating-u-s-ev-market-shows-data/](https://www.evautoblog.com/news/tesla-model-3-and-y-still-dominating-u-s-ev-market-shows-data/).  For example, they make about 10x more EVs than Ford.  With economies of scale, come cost benefits.  Competitors, except Chinese, are hurting:

* [Ford hits the brakes on $12 billion in EV spending because EVs are too expensive](https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/26/23934172/ford-12-billion-ev-investment-postpone-q3-earnings)
* [Honda CEO says firm is ending partnership with GM to develop affordable EVs](https://fortune.com/2023/10/25/honda-ceo-ending-partnership-gm-develop-affordable-evs-uaw-strike-automaker/)
* [Volkswagen to temporarily cut production of two EV models due to weaker demand](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/volkswagen-temporarily-pause-production-two-ev-car-models-due-drop-demand-2023-09-26/)

Note that Tesla continues to expand its economies of scale in the long run, by building its own lithium refining operations at Corpus Christi, TX, and continuing to scale up its in-house battery cell manufacturing capacity.  

&#x200B;

(4) Products beyond automotive

* Tesla sells stationary storage battery products (about a 6 Billion/year business from latest SEC filings), which is growing very rapidly and turns a profit at higher margins than cars.
* Future product pipeline includes AI training as a service (Dojo), and robots (Optimus android).  This is where Tesla's ability to attract top computer engineering and software engineering talent gives them a big edge.",15

That's nonsense.  ICE cars will be apart of the market for the foreseeable future, several decades at least.  There are significant parts of the market where EVs simply are not practical with current or foreseeable technology; it is just fantasy to think otherwise.

None of they legacy automakers have any plans to shut down there ICE production; you are simply making that up.

>The problem for the traditional automakers is that the EV transition isn't going to go in a straight line, it's been going in an exponential S-curve

No, that's just an absurd claim.  EV early adopters are already in the market.  The mass market is skeptical about EVs; many don't have easy access to charging, drive to much, or in isolated areas, to make charging practical.

Consumer demand is simply not there for a huge market shift in the near term.  Automakers are slowing their EV rollouts specifically for this reason.

>Point being, consumer sentiment WILL shift in favor of EV's in much larger numbers sooner or later, and if traditional automakers aren't ready then they're going to feel a lot of pain as their ICE sales tank, especially if they can't produce and sell enough EV's to counter-act those ICE losses.

ICE SUVs and trucks are where the consumer demand is.  It i going to be a long haul for EVs to chip away at that market share.  Consumers are already pushing back on increasing the EV mix, and forcing automakers to delay rollouts because of a lack of demand.  Your claim doesn't jibe with the reality in the market.

>The other problem with the above points is that it takes 3 years on average for a car to go from the idea/design phase to being brought to the market and put in the hands of consumers. So it's quite possible that traditional automakers will run out of time to make the transition and be screwed.

>China where they aren't going to be allowed to sell some types of ICE vehicles very soon

Government mandate like that won't fly in most of the US.  If the government feels the need to force consumers into a new technology, that is an indicator that the technology isn't ready for the mass market.  You are undermining your own argument here.

They started 10 years too late and the market is already largely taken, they can't sell EVs for ridiculous prices because people won't get them since there's options.

> So you are pointing out that there are so many competitors that the market is splitting up between them. You are supporting my argument that Tesla is a niche player.

Last year Tesla's market share was 71%, very niche indeed, this year now that there's more competition (particularly in the high end market, which isn't as largely affected by the current economic context) you can actually buy from it's just 57%, then again they're also selling more than last year, the market just grew. By the way, depending on what model you want to get from them there might be waiting time, they literally can't keep up with demand. Meanwhile their competitors have their EVs sitting in a parking lot lol.

> That is just not true.

Their competitors are either inferior, don't really compete with them (selling a $300k EV Porsche that loses Porsche a fortune isn't exactly competition, they aim for a different kind of people) or are going at a massive loss that they won't be able to afford. Again, they won't be able to sell their just-came-out-from-R&D cars for $100k, they'll have to sell them for 1/5 of that, and that'll cost them too much.

Companies that don't build their own infotainment systems then pay licensing money to Apple and Google, and have no control over the overall experience of the system.  

Your take on the car electronic control systems is incorrect.  It is much slower to create and update software when the electronic control systems are made by dozens or even over 100 suppliers.  Did you read what the Ford CEO said?  Trying to integrate 150 pieces of software from systems created by other companies is difficult and time consuming.  

The number of car models released has nothing to do with Tesla's electronic controls architecture.  They all use a common computing system.  Their product lineup is the result of deliberate choices not to complicate manufacturing.

17j4q1u,We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),"Overall I think Tesla will come out just fine/ too early to be worried about Tesla.   Tesla is taking steps to prepare for lessening in demand due to inflation and interest rate increases.

They have basically no debt compare to the amount of cash they are holding. They are cash flow positive and they are continuing to build up the amount they are holding.

They are able to cut pricing aggressively to generate demand while still making money on each sale while their competitors are losing money on every EV.

On Cybertruck - it’s normal for any new product to take a while to make back the initial investment in new production lines, it was the case for all the previous models Tesla produced. It will likely be priced higher than the initial introduction due to inflation and with higher interest rate there will be an impact on demand. Given they are starting with the more expensive trim, it hard to tell how much of an impact there will be since people with higher income will be less affected by interest rate.

FSD - personally I use it on my drives and it’s worth it for the initial price I got it at 5k, 5 years ago. It’s been amazing to see the progress it has made. 
For people who drive a lot, I think it’s worth getting the subscription at the current state. I view FSD / AI as nice bonus, Tesla is not going to die in if they don’t figure it out in the near future.

The energy storage business is growing very fast and has high margins, it’ll be an area to watch for on how interest rate impacts the growth.",37
17j4q1u,We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),"I'll try to play devil's advocate and present you the thought process from a fund perspective. Whenever you're considering a play, the best thing to do is to first evaluate it in the context of its industry. You've gone very granular into the risks of Tesla, but haven't really presented it in the context versus competitors (i.e comparing TSLA's book metrics vs competitors, product cost/benefit vs competitors, etc). In other words, the first thing to ask yourself is are you actually truly bearish just Tesla or just bearish the entire auto/EV industry?

&nbsp;

From a buyside institutional perspective, the reason why that question above is so important is because when presenting a trade thesis, you have to consider not just idea generation, but also **idea execution.** 

&nbsp;

So this brings me to the next point: what if in the extreme case, I told you institutions were short every auto/EV (i.e industry short) and long TSLA over the five year span I mentioned? You mention that ""the 857% total return of Tesla is substantially higher than all of its peers, including Ford, Toyota, and Volkswagen."" What if I told you institutions holding TSLA are ""only"" up 100% total return in that span? Sure, there are going to be institutions that will only hold a long TSLA as representative bet on the industry, but by in large those will be the minority of funds.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


> Elon Musk has previously alluded to a poor performing EV market in the wake of a higher interest rate environment. Economic data confirms this narrative as Automobile shipments have declined substantially in Q3’ 2023.

&nbsp;

Here, you seem to hint at industry decline. So again, why would I worry specifically about Tesla and not the whole industry? Why would I not short the entire industry altogether? And this brings me to my ultimate point: from a very long term perspective, unless you have a negative view of EVs as a whole industry, the risk adjusted returns of a long TSLA and short the ""others"" pair trade is far preferable to taking idiosyncratic, or company specific, risk.",31

I think this is important: if you drive a tesla or buy a tesla musk is going to come up in conversation and while there is plenty of apolitical people there are just as many political people who want nothing to do with the man or his products. Its constant negative press. Equally the political base he now appealing to, the right, aren't going to be buying EV vechs or cybertrucks.

The real cost is rent not labor remember that.  Owners Play the wages are too high when they never ever went up with inflation.  Really it's rent is too high.

If wages too high the employer can do it themselves they realize it's not worth it because wages too low.

There is a reason why employers won't do the same job employees do.  They see it as beneath them and pay isn't worththe amount if work being done meaning the wages are too low in The first place if it went to where it's worth it for employer to consider doing it themselves they would.

Why not set the preorder at $1,000? anyone serious about buying a truck would gladly put up that deposit and wait a year. In fact, Tesla made the reservation for the Roadster $5,000 AND there is no concrete timeframe on that vehicle.

I don't understand how anyone could arrive at this conclusion. The entire reason that hybrids exist is to combat the mileage you get on an EV charge, but that's continuing to improve, and will eventually get to the point of being as long range as gas is. What reason would hybrids have to exist after that, other than to fuel (no pun intended) the oil industry?",13

17j4q1u,We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),"It's enterprise value is so much higher than its competitors because its market cap is so much higher than its competitors. When you're talking using any metric involving market cap, you're really comparing market value of a company and not book value.

&nbsp;

I have absolutely no view on Tesla or the EV market, but why not also first compare metrics that aren't affected by public sentiment (like market cap or enterprise value are). At the simplest level compared to its competitors (thus far, and not speaking about the future), Tesla's profit margins far, far outperform on a per vehicle basis as well as on a holistic company basis. How about its free cash flow? R&D spend vs competitors? Top and bottom line projected growth vs. competitors?

&nbsp;

So the two ""company specific"" aspects to Tesla you've presented as negative catalysts, FSD and Cybertruck, are interesting. FSD is truly company specific to Tesla, but Cybertruck is not really. What I mean by this is that auto/EV makers (which is Tesla's main industry) all have the same risks from this categorical new product launch (i.e GM with EV Hummer for instance, Rivian etc). As far as I'm aware, none of the major competitors to Tesla of them have the risks that FSD presents. So if you're going to make a play on Tesla and **NOT** the industry, this would be the area of focus.",6

They are usually out within 12 hours to fix something that broke if they cant reboot it remotely. If you have a Tesla, you can see which stalls are broken in realtime and it tells you to avoid those, or if a SC is down, it will notify you on your trip and have you re-route to another one.

They don't really have on-site monitoring. All their data capture is remote (just like EA or all the other charging networks). Their hardware is just a lot simpler - and therfore more robust. 

Reliability may go down a bit with the new v4 chargers (as these incorporate screens and payment options which are poits of failure).

This is the most illogical argument you can think of. Even if 0% of those reservations convert, they can still sell millions of Cybertrucks. 99.9% of cars sold are just people buying a car long after it first hit the market. So even if 20% of those reservations convert (I personally think it'll be somewhere between 20% and 50%), that's 3+ years of production sold out, while 99.9% of sales will start after those reservations are delivered.

You misread that letter. Tesla has no intend of going above Level 2 until they solve full autonomy, as it's an unnecessary distraction. Nowhere is it written that you need a level 3 or 4 system to be able to build a fully autonomous car. It's just arbitrary benchmarks.

Unclear.  If dealing with the remaining edge cases were as simple as just solving them, then I would say Tesla is very near.  But AI does not work like that.  They have to solve the edge cases without screwing up the stuff that already works well.  And that is where we get into ultra-cutting-edge technology that nobody can predict well.  

The fact that Tesla has moved from heuristics to a fully end-to-end system should improve progress.  But unless you work for Tesla's AI team, I doubt you can shine much light on this.  

Ultimately it comes down to how much you believe in Tesla's AI team.

This is untrue.

I've been a TSLA shareholder since 2011, and was a participating member at Tesla Motors Club investor forums for much of the 2010s.  

Many of Tesla's largest, long-term retail investors (some with 400,000 to 500,000 or more TSLA shares) have significant professional expertise in engineering, computer science, and business.  It was that expertise that led many to conclude that the conventional wisdom about Tesla was incorrect.  

The unsophisticated investors who maybe buy a few shares on their Robinhood accounts, don't have the financial firepower to prop up a 700 Billion market cap.  

Looking at TSLA trading volume alone, an average of about 115 million shares traded daily over the past month, according to Yahoo Finance, that amounts to 10s of Billions of $ worth of shares trading hands every day.   This is not something that small retail can have much effect on.",4

17j4q1u,We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),"Can you read?

My entire post was about how Elon Musk lies and misleads shareholders. The market cap of Tesla is $650 billion. Musk saying that demand is ""off the hook"" and not citing that he was talking about $100 preorders is crazy. 

Now you are moving the goal posts. If the Cybertruck is on the market for years it can obviously reach a million units. The argument was about immediate demand. This is important for valuation models that drive the price of the stock price due to TVM. My argument is perfectly logical when valuing the company... I would assume you are not a finance person, so your ignorance is tolerable.

""You do not need a level 3 or 4 system to build an autonomous car""

This is a self-contradicting statement. An autonomous car is a level 3+ system. Why is Tesla not testing any of these systems? Maybe because they are not close... Meanwhile Waymo and Mobileye have Level 4 systems with no one in the driver seat. You are essentially saying that Tesla should not focus on real autonomous driving and instead focus on gimmicks.

For anyone new out there like you, rides without critical disengagements need to be substantially higher than 94% to be safe. Tesla's safety is worse than drunk drivers. So they fail the first test. The second test is rides without disengagements which measures the actual effectiveness of a system. Tesla is around 30-40% which is abysmal. An autonomous vehicle needs to be above 99% for both categories. for critical disengagement around 99.999%

I have been following Waymo's progress for a long time and I think they're already 90% of the way there, and Alphabet has basically infinite resources to improve the technology to the point of commercialization. They are fenced into SF right now but that's mostly for regulatory reasons, which if we're honest is probably a good chunk of the reason that Tesla is still only rated for level 2. I don't think level 5 will be achieved anytime soon, and as you say it comes down to solving edge cases. Waymo is already mostly there as far as I am concerned, where the car can drive on its own in a variety of conditions for extended periods of time. For the foreseeable future, there are and still will be edge case scenarios where the car needs to pull over and ask for human input. Progress is all about minimizing the number of times that it happens.

The big problem that I have with Tesla is that they break ethics, rules and regulations at every turn. They basically gave a level 2 system over to the public and marketed it as a level 4 system. They have less safeties in place so the car is more likely to just keep going and blame the driver for not taking over and avoiding the accident when something inevitably goes wrong. It has given FSD a bad name with serious crashes and fatalities, and they have worked harder to cover up any blame that Tesla might have for these incidents than they have spent investigating to find out what went wrong and how to fix it.

I don't think one can really understand Tesla as a business without a base level of knowledge about mass manufacturing, computer science, computer engineering, battery technology, and probably half a dozen more subjects.  The average Wall Street MBA isn't going to have a clue about most of this stuff.

Most of Wall Street was also blindsided by 2001 and 2008.

I believe your take is false, because while anyone can buy stock in a company, making an informed decision every day for 10+ years to continue holding that stock, does involve some degree of skill and research.  

I've been continuously weighing different factors of Tesla's business since 2011.  That means knowing the members of the leadership team, knowing the products and product pipeline, knowing the various industries Tesla operates in, reading the SEC filings, and much more. 

Many people sold their TSLA shares in a panic during various points like early 2016 and early 2019.  I continued to hold because my research indicated that the panics were unjustified and due to transitory factors. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

>Tesla was on the verge of bankruptcy not even a decade ago.

They were on the verge of bankruptcy for almost all of the 2010s.  I kept a very close eye on their cash burn rate, ability to raise capital, their debts (10+ Billion at the peak), and the interest rate and maturity date of those debts.  Most or even all of this is/was publicly available in the 10-Q and 10-K filings.  

I also was able to make an educated guess at what level of production, sales, and margin Tesla would need to escape that black hole of debt.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

> Tesla ending up as it is today is luck. 

**Nothing is all luck or all skill.**

Yes, there was some element of luck to TSLA.

If a random big earthquake had destroyed Tesla's Fremont factory at some point in the mid-2010s, Tesla probably would've gone bankrupt.  That would have been bad luck.  And it wouldn't have been unprecedented either -- the 2011 Tsunami, caused by an earthquake, severely disrupted Japanese automotive production.

If Russia had assassinated Elon Musk in the 2010s in an attempt to slow SpaceX, that would probably have led to Tesla going bankrupt during 2017-2018 ""production hell"".  That would have been bad luck too.

Tesla was lucky that legacy automakers were mostly complacent for most of the 2010s, and asleep not only to Tesla's rise, but the rise of the Chinese EV industry too.",2

EPS Q4 2022 1.13, Q1 2023 0.85, Q2 2023 0.91, Q3 0.62. You're looking into the past assuming that a growth stock will continue to grow at the same rate as it has done in the past but that is never the case and as an investment stategy is speculative at best.

After a period of sharp exponential growth there usually follows a flattening of growth, and the evidence of the past quarters is showing we are nearing that stage.

You're also ignoring the CEO's own prediction that income will decline due to increased competition and high inflation rates worldwide and the fact they have slashed prices on their cars to gain market share but cutting their own profit margin on sale which will inevitably have a negative effect on their earnings compared to 2022 and 2021.",1

17j4q1u,We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),">Buying a company with no factories or revenue in 2011 is entirely luck. 

That is not entirely true, and also misses the bigger picture.

Tesla was setting up the initial production line for Model S in 2011.  The company had bought [what is now the Tesla Factory at Fremont](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Fremont_Factory) from Toyota in 2010, after Toyota and GM shut down the NUMMI joint venture they'd previously operated there.  

The broader picture you miss is that Tesla in 2011 had a lot of talent.  The efforts of talented people are more important in a startup than the factory.  It's the talent that brings the organization to life.

Tesla's leadership team in 2011 was excellent: CTO J.B. Straubel, Model S program director Jerome Guillen (hired from Daimler), manufacturing operations executive Gilbert Passin (hired from Toyota), VP of business development Diarmuid O'Connell, VP of worldwide retail George Blankenship (former Apple exec who had developed Apple stores), and probably several others I'm forgetting at the moment.  CEO Elon Musk, as controversial as he is today, had put together a star management team.  These people were worth investing in.

&#x200B;

> If anything, your decision to hold a company that nearly went bankrupt multiple times shows how incompetent you were. 

No, this is called taking a calculated risk.  

My purchases of TSLA stock over the past 12 years represent only a small % of the total money I used to buy investments.

I took it into the shop and they put a trailer hitch on it as a buffer for rear end impacts and that was the recall resolution.",64
18hnhe8,Where's Our TSLA Bulls At Today?,"I agree there's a big difference and the industry needs to update its terminology to adapt to this new thing called the internet ... but a ""recall"" has nothing to do with where the problem is fixed. It's the company or the NHTSA officially claiming the vehicle is unsafe and needs remedy to meet minimum safety standards.",10
18hnhe8,Where's Our TSLA Bulls At Today?,"Exactly, headlines are just clickbaits for idiots like OP to fall for them all lmao",42
18hnhe8,Where's Our TSLA Bulls At Today?,"So this would be like Google or Microsoft saying they issued 5 billion recalls when they release a security patch? ?? I'm not a Musk apologist but yeah, I think the difference is that ""physical"" recalls have a massive cost while the software updates are relatively cheap.",13
18hnhe8,Where's Our TSLA Bulls At Today?,That way the “recalls” actually get done.  I have a couple on my truck. Fuck outta here I’m not tying it up while those bastards fix the airbag that might kill me…and other superfluous things.,10
18hnhe8,Where's Our TSLA Bulls At Today?,"Recall has nothing to do with how much it cost the company. 

So if it cost them 500 each car is that a re all? How about 450?

What amount is a recall?",1
18hnhe8,Where's Our TSLA Bulls At Today?,"When I see these kind of posts I feel like people are confusing auto recalls with food recalls where the products are trashed/refunded, since there are no repairs/fixes in those cases.",1
18hnhe8,Where's Our TSLA Bulls At Today?,Is FSD still worth $363920 gazillion if Tesla keeps having to recall its faulty software?,1
18hnhe8,Where's Our TSLA Bulls At Today?,"Seriously…when my Tacoma was recalled the leaf springs were poised to puncture my fucking gasoline tank. Ya know? The tank with burney blowup death water in it? 

THAT is a recall.",1

18hnhe8,Where's Our TSLA Bulls At Today?,"Its not a pain threshold thing. 

Its the boring low IQ and ego combo problem, they would have to admit to themselves, that they were wrong. And that they are not just little media regurgitating ""Elon bad"" puppies, that couldn't see the actual performance and thrive of the company itself. That would need brains and introspection. Rare traits these days.

Look at Jim Chanos who had to close his fund, ego driven low IQ clowns, literally willing to sacrifice everything but their ego...

This is an update to severely limit the use of a feature that is, if we’re being honest, vapourware. A feature you pay extra for, that has been touted as fully autonomous.

If I tell you this secret, you have to promise not to share it though. It’s life changing advice and I think you’ll agree. 

If you’re trying to *make* money (not give it away) you should try selling when the numbers are higher than the amount you paid. This is called “profit.” 

Try it again but with this new knowledge in mind. Let us know when you’re ready to post your gains based on this knowledge. 

P.S. Please don’t tell everyone about this or report me to the S.E.C.

Walmart entered the German market in 1997 with the acquisition of the Wertkauf and Interspar hypermarket chains. However, Walmart’s German stores struggled because its business model wasn’t working there. Walmart wanted to follow the below-cost strategy, but the German business owners didn’t like Walmart’s low-cost pricing tactic as well as the German government. As a result, the American giant was ordered to raise its prices by the German high court which became an obstacle for it to having a customer base. Walmart and German unions were incompatible. In Germany, unlike in the US, unions are very much a part of the culture and have broad support amongst the government, the community, and even businesses. Walmart didn’t understand that in Germany, companies and unions are closely connected. Also, The German workforce is accustomed to negotiating their pay with their union. This caused friction between the workers and the company. When Walmart refused to join Germany’s regional wage bargaining system, the worker’s union went on strike. Walmart was taken aback for this reason. This also gave them a bad reputation in the community and likely affected their sales.",17

“First, government incentives have made EVs the best financial choice for consumers. Norwegians who buy all-electric vehicles do not have to pay high value-added taxes or registration taxes and receive other financial benefits as well.”


“Second, the government has invested heavily in EV chargers and as a result Norway has the most public fast chargers per capita of any country in the world. These can get an EV battery from zero to 80% in as little as 20 minutes. In addition, Norway has established a right to charge for people living in apartment buildings and provides grants for housing associations to install their own chargers.

Third, Norway has also provided EV owners with some attractive perks, such as free parking in cities, exemptions or reductions in road tolls, access to priority bus lanes and reduced rates for EVs to be transported by ferry (ferries are frequently used given Norway’s fjord-covered landscape).

18ch3n7,Danish pension funds (43 billion USD) starts selling TSLA stocks due to labor union dispute,"You do not understand how collective agreements work - this is like saying that supporting the [minimum wage of 10.42£ in the UK](https://www.acas.org.uk/national-minimum-wage-entitlement) means that you want every person in the UK to earn 10.42£.

In Sweden we have no minimum wage - 90% of our companies are part of these collective agreements with the union.[It's not only about salaries - it's about insurance, pensions, salary increases and fairness.](https://www.beyondo.se/news/collective-agreements-in-sweden)

Technology & Options do not solve worker rights. They are not ""getting pension funds and governments involved"" - our government is very much NOT allowed to get involved even if they have tried to get the unions to stop. Our unions are very sympathetic and work together. This is why the postal workers, harbour workers and unions in Norway and Denmark have started to ""sympathize strike"" against Tesla.

IF is not losing - they are just following procedure with the rest of the unions when ""rock star CEOs"" try to ignore our ruleset. [According to the numbers they have 10 billion SEK in their battle chest which is enough to keep the strike going for 500 years.](https://omni.se/if-metall-star-redo-med-10-miljarder-i-strejkkassan/a/veBVxL)

Companies have tried this before - [Toys R US had to give up and form a special case for Sweden with their ""no union policy""](https://www.huffpost.com/archive/ca/entry/what-canada-can-learn-from-swedens-unionized-retail-workers_n_6888328) and[Amazon had to change to a third-hand-party with collective agreement because you can't fight the unions here](https://www.politico.eu/article/amazons-cut-price-culture-meets-swedens-unions/). The reason the unions are fighting hard is because that's why they exist. To force companies to fall in line to Swedish worker demands.

[Sweden is among the most unionized countries in the world](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1356735/labor-unions-most-unionized-countries-worldwide/) with 65.7% of the workforce unionized. You can't just ignore that if you want to last here.  


Edit:    
\> *IF is fighting hard and it’s definitely not going their way, otherwise  they wouldn’t have to get pension funds and governments involved.*   


This is the dumbest argument. It's like saying *""the US is fighting Japan hard and it's definitely not going their way, otherwise they wouldn't have to get nuclear bombs or ships involved.""*

Stuff like the pension funds and getting other countries Unions involved are powerful weapons that make the fight go IF's way.",11
18ch3n7,Danish pension funds (43 billion USD) starts selling TSLA stocks due to labor union dispute,"I mean that's just how entry level salaries work. And from my understanding new car mechanics with no experience on their first job all make more than 23 000 due to the high demand for them so it's not surprising in the least that Tesla has higher entry level salaries than what the CBA requires. Everyone else does too. The 23 000 SEK is a floor for newbies the times when there isn't a high demand.

I mean do you \_really\_ believe that all the other mechanics at BMW, Volvo, Ford etc only make 23 000? Of course you don't, that would be stupid.

And if it was only about salaries there probably wouldn't be a strike. The CBA is about pensions, insurances, overtime payments and yearly raises to name a few areas where Tesla has fallen short according to employees on strike,",1

If you followed the story of reusable rockets, you'd understand that Shuttle and Falcon 9 are radically different designs. Comparing them the way you have done here - extrapolating the failures of Shuttle to Falcon 9 - can only be described as disingenuous.

You have spun a narrative here, that is fair to say. I'm sure some of those unfamiliar with the subject will find it quite convincing.",6

18ch3n7,Danish pension funds (43 billion USD) starts selling TSLA stocks due to labor union dispute,"What are you smoking the Falcon 9 is the cheapest per kg launch by a long shot with the soyuz-2 coming in second with like 30% the efficiency. Ignoring the fact that the USA would like to pay a premium to not be tied to a Russian system. Sure not every launch needs that capacity, but even if it's only at 1/4 load it's still competitive, and probably still the most reliable.  


Your numbers are also a bit wonky. So fuel in rockets is the cheap part of them compared to everything else, and weight of payload is far more the limiting factor for fuel usage than reuse. So yeah reusing the rocket cuts the amount of payload it can carry, however the falcon 9 can carry way more than all but the ULAs Atlas V, in it's weight group. And the Atlas V costs over 40million more to launch currently. The ones even bigger than that cost astronomical amounts and are rarely used. Which the Falcon 9 heavy crushes in both max weight liftable and expected cost.",1
