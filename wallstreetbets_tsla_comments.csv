Let's be honest fellow wacknuts, Tesla is currently the FTM, market leader, so they got the bulls by the horns.

Now the CT may not (ok, no F-ING WAY) be the big thing Musk thought it would be but still, they got years to keep being ahead. Well, at least  a few until most car companies are using NAC standard but at the point Tesla will then be getting a cut of EVERY car built using their standard and a cut of EVERY car charging since they will use their super chargers.

Walmart entered the German market in 1997 with the acquisition of the Wertkauf and Interspar hypermarket chains. However, Walmart‚Äôs German stores struggled because its business model wasn‚Äôt working there. Walmart wanted to follow the below-cost strategy, but the German business owners didn‚Äôt like Walmart‚Äôs low-cost pricing tactic as well as the German government. As a result, the American giant was ordered to raise its prices by the German high court which became an obstacle for it to having a customer base. Walmart and German unions were incompatible. In Germany, unlike in the US, unions are very much a part of the culture and have broad support amongst the government, the community, and even businesses. Walmart didn‚Äôt understand that in Germany, companies and unions are closely connected. Also, The German workforce is accustomed to negotiating their pay with their union. This caused friction between the workers and the company. When Walmart refused to join Germany‚Äôs regional wage bargaining system, the worker‚Äôs union went on strike.

If a company cannot raise capital as effectively through selling equity (such as when its stock value goes down), it has to look at other methods of raising that capital such as going into debt. A competent lender will see a higher debt-equity ratio and raise its interest rate for that loan (I'll happily explain why if you'd like), which is definitely bad for the company's finances.

‚ÄúFirst, government incentives have made EVs the best financial choice for consumers. Norwegians who buy all-electric vehicles do not have to pay high value-added taxes or registration taxes and receive other financial benefits as well.‚Äù


‚ÄúSecond, the government has invested heavily in EV chargers and as a result Norway has the most public fast chargers per capita of any country in the world. These can get an EV battery from zero to 80% in as little as 20 minutes. In addition, Norway has established a right to charge for people living in apartment buildings and provides grants for housing associations to install their own chargers.

Third, Norway has also provided EV owners with some attractive perks, such as free parking in cities, exemptions or reductions in road tolls, access to priority bus lanes and reduced rates for EVs to be transported by ferry (ferries are frequently used given Norway‚Äôs fjord-covered landscape).

Sure not every launch needs that capacity, but even if it's only at 1/4 load it's still competitive, and probably still the most reliable.  


Your numbers are also a bit wonky. So fuel in rockets is the cheap part of them compared to everything else, and weight of payload is far more the limiting factor for fuel usage than reuse. So yeah reusing the rocket cuts the amount of payload it can carry, however the falcon 9 can carry way more than all but the ULAs Atlas V, in it's weight group.
