187jloa,Unilever Stock - Opinions?,"FTSE is facing very low valuations in general. Whether that trend continues or it’s due a rebound is anyone’s guess. 

For unilever specifically their core brands have not done so well recently, hence the lack of growth. Just my opinion, but I’d think your decision shouldn’t be about dividends but how much you believe those brands and their future strategy will be winners or not. Dividends are nice but growth in earnings underpin both dividends and valuation. With consumer goods, it’s all down to the product. FTSE all world at least would mean you’re more diversified.",4

I see comments like the above in this thread and I honestly just don't think it's true. 

Fed has delivered 6 decade low unemployment we haven't seen in forever.  Wages at the lowest quintile are increasing dramatically, way faster than inflation.  These are REAL wage gains.

There's tons of job openings at ALL job levels.  Want to make way, way more?  Great!! There's tons of different skills for every personality type you can learn to get ahead.  

Want to stay in shift / minimum wage work but a different employer?  That's fine too!  There's tons of jobs with different environments if that's what you want.  No one is forcing you to be a barista.

17wm2xm,SBUX workers file more labor complaints with NYC as union goes on largest-ever strike,"
So you are saying every job, regardless of skill level, should provide a wage high enough to afford a 'decent living' even in high-cost areas?. Let's take a hypothetical scenario: if a cashier at your local grocery store or a barista at Starbucks were to earn $30/hour, how do you think that would impact the cost of goods and services? Higher wages in these roles would likely lead to increased costs for consumers. 

People in fields like engineering, medicine, and finance earn higher wages in NYC, often in line with their specialized skills and training. In contrast, service sector jobs, which might have provided decent pay in the economy of the 70s and 80s, now face a different economic reality. Today's economy is more tech-driven, and the value placed on specialized skills has increased accordingly. 

The reality is, if a job requires only a short training period, say two weeks, this often implies a higher potential for employee turnover and replaceability. This factor is a significant consideration in wage determination. we need to be realistic about the economic impact and sustainability of significantly higher wages for entry-level, low-skill positions in the current tech driven economy.",4

(You said it with more fancy words about why the market pays more to finance/tech/medical, and how we need to be 'realistic', but that's the crux of the message).

My contention is that we shouldn't structure our society such that vast quantities of people have to live on the margins.

Some ways to accomplish this include putting caps on the ratio of CEO:worker pay, taxing large companies for the money their employees use on government assistance, expanding public services overall, forcing companies to engage in greater profit sharing, etc.

These companies are making massive profits. Starbucks has an operating margin of [16%](https://investor.starbucks.com/press-releases/financial-releases/press-release-details/2023/Starbucks-Reports-Q4-and-Full-Year-Fiscal-2023-Results/default.aspx).

If all the sudden these jobs were to increase wages like that it would create such a huge inflationary wage spiral across the board that literally everything would double in price or more. These companies aren’t just going to take the margin hit like that, they’re just not….and prices are going up by a lot to compensate all the way down the supply chain. Starbucks isn’t just going to sit back and be like “Wellp, guess we’re just gonna have to pay everyone 30$/hour and cut our margins to a 3rd of what they used to be.”. Then what about that nurse who was making 30$/ hour seeing these 18-20 year old kids making the same money they do with 0 skills and 0 college education? They’re going to demand higher wages now too or else why even be a nurse anymore and deal with that stress? Just go work at a McDonald’s or Starbucks or Chipotle and get your 30$ an hour. The inflationary effects of doubling entry level job wages like that would do more harm than good to the overall economy. Most of these jobs are for high schoolers or college kids working their way through, they’re not meant to be career paying like jobs you can go out and buy a house and start a family on.

The former owner's goals and circumstances will likely be different than yours.  

I strongly believe that if someone is going to own individual stocks, they should be doing so actively and should be commiting time each week and even each day on that.  Otherwise, you can pay someone to manage it for you.  

Being newly retired (?) your priorities might be around tax optimization and stable income and capital preservation but still needing some growth.   

The names you're soliciting, here is some common sentiment on them.  I don't endorse or reject it, I just relay it.

PFE has been deemed a loser in the suffering sector of big pharma.  The speculation now is that maybe it is getting to be so bad it's good.  

JNJ has assymetric risk from ongoing litigation.  Rightly or wrongly, they're going through a tumbler of expensive litigation and settlements.  Maybe they can beat some of it and emerge.  But the thesis would be why take that bumpy ride with them if there are hundreds of other stocks that are good and don't have that form of risk.

Cummins has been battered of late but is kind of best of breed of what they do.  If one believes that infrastructure and building and global recovery are imminent, then Cummins will prosper from that.  

Deere is seen as agriculture and infrastructure/construction.  Agriculture has been battered too, and Deere, being one that rode very high, has been getting taken back down.  Similar concepts as with Cummins, if one believes in things happening through 2024 that benefit heavy industry, that can help Deere.  However Deere is exposed to the ups and downs of Ag.  

Notice that you have some overlaps with PFE/JNJ and DE/CMI.  

Wells Fargo is considered one of the weak sisters of banking along with C Citigroup.  Sometimes you can gamble on these more-disliked plays whe they rebound from ""hated"" to merely ""despised"".  If doing that, you'd want that to be a conscious strategy though.  But again, not best of breed here.",3

JNJ - a stronger hold than PFE. Actually a growing company too.  
  
CMI - idk much about it but it seems to be a strong, growing company. I would hold.  
  
WFC - I wouldn’t sell unless you have a specific preferred place to put the money. Price to book is below 1 which implies its at a cheap price but that does depend on some things.    
  
DE - should be a strong performer but idk much in specifics

Look at it this way. If tomorrow, the entire country went mad and started selling houses for $1, would you not buy up as many houses as you could? That's because you realize that houses have intrinsic value, regardless of what someone is willing to pay for them. If you could rent out your house for $3,000 a month, then paying $1 for it on the market would be an unbelievable opportunity.

17m3pf5,Opinion: Alternative Investments will Prevent a Stock Crash,"I did engage with a point in the actual article. He values google at 0.  Only dividend stocks have value to him.  This is idiotic.  Owning 1 share of Merck gets you a dividend.  According to his valuation metric, that 1 share of Merck is worth more than 100% ownership of google.  Anyone who would trade 100% of google for 1 share of Merck is, unequivocally, not a good investor.  This does not require further explanation. Nevertheless, I will briefly explain some small portion of the sheer idiocy of this article.

1. The author defines an investor as only being someone who would buy something even if they were unable to ever sell it.  This is a terrible definition.  It in no way aligns with the purposes of investing. 

2. He argues that dividends are the only purpose of stocks.  This is narrowminded, and factually incorrect.  Dividends are one feature of some stocks.  The purpose of stocks is to enable fractional ownership interests of an enterprise, and the purchase and sale of such fractional ownership interests. For most investors, the purpose of investing is to generate a positive return on your investment, whatever form that takes. Admittedly, some investors choose stocks for reasons other than pecuniary gain, but that is an idea that I personally believe is inherently silly.

3. He seems to think most people would buy a house they could never sell, ostensibly without discounting the price of it, and that the willingness of someone to pay more later is irrelevant to price.  This is inherently stupid.  (One reason is that it would permanently tie you to one location, which for a great many people is a non-starter.)  When you buy a T-Bill or a savings bond, you are not buying a steady income stream. You are buying a promise from the government to pay more to get it back at a later date.  The entire value is in the increased payment on surrender of the instrument.  That does not make it something other than an investment.

4.  By the author's definition, Berkshire Hathaway is worthless, and Warren Buffet is, ostensibly, poor, because Berkshire Hathaway does not produce a dividend.  This is silly.  While Berkshire Hathaway does not pay a dividend, it does own a great many shares in dividend aristocrat stocks, and by owning an interest in that, you essentially own a fractional interest in those holdings. Putting them inside a holding company does not, in fact, render them worthless.

5. The author claims that you can predict the future price of a company by some combination of its dividends and its dividend growth rates, and states that he requires dividends as proof of value.  Dividends are terrible proof of value.  That is not what they are for.  In fact, there have been a great many companies to offer growing dividends right up to the point where they take a turn and result in bankruptcy, losing you your principle.  Additionally, it is worth pointing out that per his analysis, companies that don't produce dividends in fact do continue to trade above $0, which means you cannot predict their price by his metric.

6.  If only things that generate an income stream have value, then a briefcase full of cash is worthless. A briefcase full of gold is worthless. A tanker full of oil is worthless.  

7. I once had a friend tell me that gold was worth so much more than cash, that he'd pay $2,000 in cash for $1,000 worth of gold. I told him I had $1,000 worth of gold, and would gladly sell it to him for $2,000, with which I would then buy twice that much gold, and I'd be willing to do that transaction as many times as he wanted.  He instantly realized his error and declined to move forward with the deal.  Anyone who claims that buying something because you believe someone will pay more for it later is not investing, is not an investor.

8. After pages of rambling discourse including such gems as calling dividends the purpose of stocks, valuing all non-dividend companies at 0, and stating that companies future price can be established by looking at dividend and dividend growth alone, he has the audacity to claim he is not a dividend investor.  This is ludicrous.

9. The author values google at 0, because it does not produce a dividend.  If that does not cause you to label him an idiot and view everything else he says with extreme skepticism, you might be ""hard of thinking.""

10. As per my quote above, anyone who reads this article and buys into it will be dumber for having read it.  Unless they're incredibly lucky, they'll also be poorer for it.

I am not claiming dividends are worthless. Some of my portfolio is in stocks that produce dividends.  Dividends are, however, a piece of the picture and not the picture itself.  If I could have the Hope Diamond, the Mona Lisa, and all the gold in Fort Knox somewhere producing 0 income, I'd trade my entire portfolio for them... then I'd liquidate them, because I could, because they have value that is not tied to any periodic revenue stream that they create.",3

17m3pf5,Opinion: Alternative Investments will Prevent a Stock Crash,"This is one of the reasons why the rich get richer, and the poor get poorer. In a crash situation when everyone is losing their job, it's only those with disposable cash that can afford to buy assets at rock bottom prices.

For example, before 2008, private equity hardly ever invested in residential real estate. It was too ""bitty"". But in 2008 during the housing crash. At that time, companies like Blackstone were the only ones able to raise vast amounts of capital at rock-bottom interest rates that were unavailable to ordinary people for precisely the reasons that you pointed out - namely that they had lost their job and were foreclosing.

Blackstone generated obscene profits during that time.

>For most investors, the purpose of investing is to generate a positive return on your investment, whatever form that takes.

Again, Bitcoin has fantastic returns according to this definition.

>When you buy a T-Bill or a savings bond, you are not buying a steady income stream. You are buying a promise from the government to pay more to get it back at a later date. The entire value is in the increased payment on surrender of the instrument. That does not make it something other than an investment.

It's still a forced income stream. The bond will mature and you will be forced to accept whatever payments it generates as long as you hold it. Even with a zero coupon bond, you'll be forced to receive the income.

>there have been a great many companies to offer growing dividends right up to the point where they take a turn and result in bankruptcy, losing you your principle

Individual examples aren't persuasive. There are many non-dividend companies that are terrible investments as well. The claim is not that dividends are proof of value by themselves. There is a difference between a condition being necessary and the condition being sufficient.

>If only things that generate an income stream have value, then a briefcase full of cash is worthless. A briefcase full of gold is worthless. A tanker full of oil is worthless.

And a wallet full of Bitcoin?

>Anyone who claims that buying something because you believe someone will pay more for it later is not investing, is not an investor.

By this definition, Warren Buffett is not an investor. He said recently that he wouldn't pay $25 for all the Bitcoin in the world.
