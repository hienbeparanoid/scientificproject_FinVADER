Running into Anti-trust lawsuits has been a huge concern for Microsoft since last time they almost got clapped. Here you are making the case for acquiring probably one of the worst acquisitions they could possibly do that can lead to this becoming an issue again. For essentially no real upside for Microsoft as a whole. Yet not once you mention this glaring problem with your thesis.

If you say ""Duh but what about ATVI"", ATVI is not even remotely the same, them aquiring Lumen would be straight up the No no word when trying to avoid Anti-trust Lawsuits: ""Vertical Integration"". Unlike a Lumen acquisition they already owned gaming studios and publishers before acquiring ATVI.

Your whole regarded thesis is dead in the water alone by this simple fact.",3

18fn1n6,I believe Microsoft (MSFT) is prepping Lumen (LUMN) for an acquisition.,"Lumen and Microsoft would be an incredibly bad fit. Management is largely happy keeping the lights on (I've done work with them, and have seen how they wouldn't splash water on themselves if they all caught on fire).

Lumen is a service provider. Full stop. They are on legacy architecture and are terrified of modernizing (again, I've worked with them before). To call them ""extremely risk averse"" would be the understatement of the century. They have made literally no movement on getting off of their legacy platform that literally everyone on the board wants to get off of.

Microsoft's entire Enterprise GTM is centered around Partners doing the work. Buying Lumen would undermine that to the massive partner community they've spent decades building up. If Microsoft were to go down this route, they'd buy a lean company that wasn't literally terrified of moving forward. Buying Lumen would be the equivalent of buying a farm to raise horses after seeing Ford release the Model T. This entire thing sounds like the Co-CEO offering to give away half a million Blackberry's to undermine the release of the iPhone (deal was turned down).

I want to be clear, theres plenty of brilliant people that I've loved working with at Lumen. But the corporate structure is so rigid, that they can't put one foot in front of another. I have made strong friendships there.

I love Lumen. But why would Microsoft end their GTM play for decades to buy a company that can't chew gum and walk? This would be worse than them buying Nokia by high multipliers.

I'm sorry if that was rough. Sometimes the truth needs to be said.

With all of that said, I think the board does want to chop the company up into parts and sell it all off. I've heard far too much about a refusal to create a game plan to fix things.",3

18fn1n6,I believe Microsoft (MSFT) is prepping Lumen (LUMN) for an acquisition.,"In comparison, however, the equity ratio has been rising since 2019 and is recovering. Additionally, the equity ratio is not a conclusive item, as it must be evaluated depending on the industry. Moreover, it is highly unreliable since equity can be composed not only from the stated balance sheet positions but also from hidden reserves.

Asset Coverage Ratio 2:

In theory, a high level of long-term debt isn't necessarily negative if there is a maturity match with the useful life of long-term assets.

Asset Coverage Ratio 2: (10,437 + 30,341) / 40,161 = 1.0154 = 101.54%

Only when the value falls below 100% should concerns arise as it could indicate that repayment of short-term loans may cause liquidity constraints.

Regarding objections to Lumen's liquidity situation: Unfortunately, I only have figures for the total 'current assets' without a specific breakdown of its composition. Hence, I can only refer to the quick ratio and obtain the following values:

2021: 11,536 / 7,169 = 1.6092 = 160.92%

2022: 5,420 / 4,803 = 1.1285 = 112.85%

Desirable values range between 120-150%, which cannot be achieved in 2022.

However, this indicator from my side is also hardly conclusive since it's not apparent how much monetary current assets Lumen actually has available.

But what truly interests us all is the interest on the debt concerning our heavily indebted company.

Given the total capital return of -3.4%, I can insert this into the formula to determine the EBIT in connection with the total capital.

\-0.034 = EBIT / 45,581 = -1,549.754 EBIT

EBT: -991

Interests: -1,549.754 + 991 = -558.754

558.754 / 35,144 = 0.0159 = 1.60% interest rate... but this somehow seems incorrect.

Thanks for this post. I'm brand new to stocks, and I've been looking for THE stock that bottomed out and had no place to go but up, and I believe you showed it to me.

The new CEO seems to believe in the new direction enough to put her money where her mouth is.  
(I linked to an article that showed where Kate Johnson invested almost $1mil of her own money into stocks, but the ModBot didn't like it... and this was my first post, too! You can search for Kate Johnson on WSJ, though...)

...and her pedigree is pretty impressive.

Thanks again for the post!",2

In the 10k you also learn that Lumen has system issues internally because they are still using legacy infrastructure to facilitate these deals. Most of their expenditure is bringing these work tools up to date. 

A great example of the impacts of legacy systems would be Southwest and their legacy system shutting them down.

Kate took over a sinking ship, cut the dead weight, is streamlining the UX, and needs to improve the employee experience.

Once these are completed Lumen has the network, accounts, and the physical infrastructure to allow Microsoft to easily handle the massive growth of 5G, AI, gaming and every other buzzword there is.

Will Microsoft purchase the whole package, probably not, will Lumen likely sell those pieces off in the near future; we’ll see. This is a post speculating a business with $40B in Assets, $20B in debt, and $17B of annual revenue leaning its expenditure because it lost $1.5B last year.
