2. Jack Ma walked back his stock sale after the criticism and downward trend of BABA.
3. BABA still leads with Alipay, yes the retail aspect is losing market share. Do note that these other companies are offering discounts after discounts to get market share. Once the discounts are gone how can you undercut BABA?
4. BABA as a whole might not be around 5 years later, but the payment system is hard to beat in China when digital wallets are the normal. BABA allows you to use foreign account digitally to pay when in China. The Chinese do not jump ship that easily, hence why Apple Pay is not super popular in China. Alipay has a Google like effect in China and has more room to run. 
5. Jack Ma will not let his company fail, he’s acting in the shadows for his family’s safety. He’s still calling the shots at BABA and biding his time.
6. BABA is a hold until after 2027 when the next election occurs .",2

2) It’s hard to see how the dividend yield of less than 2% for the Chinese-based company is going to attract income investors when they have much better risk-free alternatives closer to home.
3) At the same time, the buyback program has been ongoing since 2021, but that didn’t stop the shares from depreciating even more. 
4) The founder Jack Ma is leaving Alibaba
5) The negative market reaction to Alibaba’s latest earnings results indicates that the new geopolitical reality with heightened macro risks will continue to be more important for investors than the company’s fundamentals. What’s more, is that it appears that there’s nothing that the company’s management can do to change the situation.

Tensions like this, historically, are temporary...or war is declared. It could break in a poor direction, too, but I see chimps yanking on vines trying to show who is the biggest and baddest. 

Because of that, investors are scared, and the price of BABA has been driving down, down, down. It reached a point that I think is nearish to the bottom, (could go down to ~60, though) and I want to see what the next 5 years brings when the world inevitably makes amends (or goes to war) and makes it work like we usually do.

Okay. You are saying Twitter turned a profit for a couple of years and not others because of legal troubles. This was during the biggest economic boom in recent memory. 0% ffr, everyone trapped in their houses increasing Internet usage, and lots of helicopter money. Now it's been a year and the script has flipped. We have a 5% ffr and economic conditions are restrictive. What kind of quarterly loss are they taking right now? 

>His other companies are successful because they've attracted great talent and then built up a layer of management to manage Elon - run with his good ideas and ignore his bad ideas. 

This could very well be true. I don't work directly for him so I have no idea. That said, whatever methodology he uses, it's been extremely successful. 


>He is like a virus, and those companies had time to grow an immune response to him.

Don't think this is a fair statement.  Virus implies he is net negative. If that was the case and companies were being successful despite him damaging, then ceo would be a meaningless position. Why aren't other companies pulling Jon Does off the street to build trillion dollar companies... Why is it that whenever he gets involved, amazing companies are built...

>At Twitter, he fired all of the experts and he's just flailing around digging the hole deeper.

You mean he cut all the fat and brought out his own software people to review the product? Did he cut to much initially? Yes. Was this type of change needed for success? Also yes. The company was hemorrhaging money. 


At the end of the day, I'm very happy that he was willing to take the platform over. He has provided a town square that might not be perfect, but is far better than anything else around. You should be concerned that the government was actively suppressing free speech, sometimes even actively deceiving the public to hide true information.

So, 1 billion per model over a 2 - 5 year cycle, all the while your margins are getting lower / sales reduce. That's a lot of time and money Tesla will have to invest and they have run out of early adopters.

175fio1,"Hello, please look at my Tsla and nvda calls, they are way above strike but worth almost nothing, why is that?","I only read a few comments so in case you haven’t figured it out yet or gotten the answer:

You are buying the right to execute a contract that says you can buy 100 shares of TSLA at $260. You want to do this because you think the price of the stock itself will go up but since you are buying the contract ahead of time, there’s always the possibility that you’ll be right. That possibility is called time value and since the person selling you the contract is in it to make money, they are gonna charge you for that time value. 
So you are buying the contract with real money and the contract is priced based on how likely the market thinks it is that TSLA will go up in price and by how much. 
The price you pay for the contract is not the actual purchase of any stock, and when it comes time to buy the stock, the cost to do that is completely different than the cost of the contract. You don’t HAVE to execute the contract and purchase the 100 shares of TSLA per contract, but if it goes up in price, you want to. You DO however have to pay for that contract (upfront) and you never get that money back. What that means, is that if you want to make money by buying an option, the stock price has to go up enough to outweigh the cost of buying at the set contract (strike) price. Here is an example or two:
Profit) 1 TSLA $260 strike call. Contract cost $80. TSLA stock goes to $265. On expiration, you execute the option to buy 100 shares at $260 and immediately sell them at $265. $500 profit minus the $80 for the contract = $420 profit (nice)

Break even) 1 TSLA $260 strike call. Contract cost $80. TSLA stock goes to $260.80. You can execute, buy the 100 shares at $260, and immediately sell at $260.80 for an $80 profit but you know where I’m going with this. The profit is eaten by the initial cost and you walk away unscathed. (Note that even if the stock price only got as high as $260.70, it would still be worth executing because your losses would then only be $10

Loss) 1 TSLA $260 strike call. Contract cost $80. You messed up and bought the option on the same day as I bought TSLA stock so of course TSLA crashed. At expiration, the stock price is $230. You don’t want to execute, because you would have to buy at $260 and then what? You could just buy them without a contract now for $230. 

Cost per option contract divided by 100 plus strike price = your break-even point.

Note that you can also make money with options by buying them, holding them until the stock price goes up signaling good things to come (increase in time value) and then sell the contract for a profit. This is dangerous because time value decreases with each passing hour and day. 

Profits are unlimited on calls, losses are limited to the amount you paid for the contract(s)
The opposite is true for puts. Unlimited losses. Don’t do this.

Hope this is helpful and good luck!",1

175fio1,"Hello, please look at my Tsla and nvda calls, they are way above strike but worth almost nothing, why is that?","Check the options Delta. Delta measures how much the option's price will react to changes in the price of the underlying share. Delta goes from 0 to 100, 100 meaning that 1 dollar move in the underlying will translate to 1 dollar price move in the option, delta of 50 = 1$ move in the underlying moves the option 0.5$ and so on. Delta can also be seen as rough estimate (in %) of the option expiring in the money. Delta will rise in the money and fall out of the money. These changes in delta are called gamma. The less time to expiration, the higher is your gamma (unless you're deep in or out the money). Gamma has a flip side though, it comes with theta - i.e. time value depreciation. The higher your gamma, the higher your theta. Unless you go for smah & grab trades, i would roll the option 1m before expiry to the next, as theta will eat a higher portion of your extrinsic value the closer you get to expiry. (Imagine 20 days left, each day costs you 5%. Only 3 days left, each day costs you 33%) And then there's vega, that's how your option reacts to changes in implied volatility. This is especially relevant for in & at the money options with some duration. The higher the implied volatility, the more expensive option, the larger the move required to actually make money from buying the option. You may also wanna look into spreads, e.g. buying a call with a lower strike and selling one with a higher strike. Or buying a put with a higher strike and selling a put with a lower strike. Divide the difference between strikes by the difference in premium (that you pay on a net basis) to see your maximum return, e.g. 10$ strike diff / 2.5$ premium = you 4x your 'investment' when the option expires at or above your higher short call or at or below your lower put.",1
175fio1,"Hello, please look at my Tsla and nvda calls, they are way above strike but worth almost nothing, why is that?","Based on your comments - you aren't familiar with how buyers of call options price them. There are concepts of time decay and marginal profit that are at play here. For one - the breakeven on the calls you bought is as follows: Cost/100 + strike price. In essence, you have to cover the strike price and the derivative premium to be profitable. The share price being at or near the strike price is bad news with only a week or two left to create intrinsic value. There are lots of other factors to analyze for call options to determine their worth. Ultimately - I would recommend you do a lot of research on this area of the market before buying any more options.",1
175fio1,"Hello, please look at my Tsla and nvda calls, they are way above strike but worth almost nothing, why is that?",The real answer to your question is because premiums are expensive.

It just comes down to adding more battery packs and running statistics on how that jump in price will affect sales.

Lucid also sells vehicles with significantly better range. They BOASTED about that range when unveiling the Air. It was so important that everyone knew a lucid had more range than a tesla. Except it means the car is 10 grand more expensive than it needs to be and they struggle to sell even half their inventory.

The market of people who need to drive 470 miles a day without ever stopping or having access to electricity overnight to charge is pretty minuscule. Most folks just prefer shorter range, a cheaper price tag, and more charging infrastructure- which is what Tesla offers",76

Tesla can easily fit enough cells in their cars to match or even beat this 466 mile estimate if they really wanted to. The issue is for every extra cell you add it makes the car significantly heavier which makes it harder to maneuver and accelerate quickly while also reducing efficiency. This makes it a worse overall car unless going on road trips. Sure it’d be nice  to have extra range as an option for the Teslas but it would have to be significantly more costly for a car that will be inferior in many ways. Tesla has very few models and trims for the sake of production streamlining which has enabled them to grow faster than any car company ever.,1

Mercedes PHEV hybrids are currently priced about 10-15k higher than the ICE versions. That's for small battery PHEVs that are built on the same ICE platform (so they're cheap to make).  

Where I'm at, including incentives, the entry-level CLA PHEV is 42k (47k sticker price) while the new Model 3 begins at 32k.

From their current EV range the EQE 300 which is somewhat similar to the Model 3 in range and power starts at 64k.",1

16b72u1,Mercedes unveils new electric concept cars with better range than any Tesla model. Puts on TSLA?!,"Also about build quality. And with quality u mean how tiny the margins of the parts are to achieve a lower cw value, to have less drag... Mercedes did the c class as ""blue efficiency"" model back in 2009 when I bought mine. The only thing they did different was use tighter margins for all the parts like hood, doors and so on, to achieve a lower drag coefficient (called cw value here) and you got like another 150km of range...",9
16b72u1,Mercedes unveils new electric concept cars with better range than any Tesla model. Puts on TSLA?!,"Who are you crying for/protecting with this subliminally Pro Tesla persuasive essay?

The market of people requiring to drive a fully loaded vehicle with an overall lower GVWR (gross vehicle weight when fully loading an electric vehicle vs an ICE vehicle) is much much higher than you realize but you're either too inexperienced to see the whole market or again trying to persuade the reader with a very biased and delusional opinion of typical driver wants and needs.

Yes, more batteries equals more range depending how you decide to design an electric vehicle, there are enough spaces to install more batteries, change the vehicle weight vs towing capacity vs on board carrying capacity to the point that you're basically driving a battery on wheels... kind of defeats the purpose of having a truck,  or van, or semi truck whose only purpose is to deliver as much as possible and carry as heavy a load as possible within safety laws and regulations based on that vehicles GVWR.

Your opinion completely ignores professional movers, delivery, taxi, logistics in general. It leaves out the fact that developing a different battery that is lighter in weight and offers a more dense charge and thus more range at less weight so a delivery driver can continue their long, strenuous route that may require more range due to heavier towing loads requiring more from the vehicle both ICE or electric,  heavy loaded vehicles towing or even a passenger filled electric car driving long distance may not make it the full ""estimated"" distance, may not even come close with Tesla currently being sued and investigated for faking range numbers among various other issues they're having both legally and transparently.

Mercedes also is delivering a realistic electric semi truck at a realistic price based on current competition in the ev sector, I mean be real Tesla and Elon Musk sort of created a little monopoly on the vision of electric cars and with the help of people like you down playing just how complicated the entire production of electric vehicles really is, from how much it costs to build a fleet of long range electric trucks capable of performing at the same level as their ICE similarly weighted and sized counterparts (Ford Lightning vs Fords other trucks of similar weight and size probably offer insanely different HP and torque packages for example), to what it takes to make batteries and gather raw materials ethically.

Tesla hasn't been able to do much more than use billions of dollars in tax paid subsidies and investors like Saudi Arabia to build a gigafactory all over the world and then promote China as being better workers than everyone else while continuing to reap the rebates the US offers Tesla drivers. 

It's a sad joke in the end who to purchase from because you're now being forced to make an ethical consumer decision on top of whether you're spending $10k more or not on a car that is the future. 400 + range and batteries not made from child labor harvesting the raw metals to begin with is all I want so I can drive a fully loaded vehicle up Ike's Gauntlet and then some and feel fine as a daisy in the summertime.

Mercedes saying they are delivering on that is a big enough reason for investors and countries to switch over from Teslas Monopoly and Elon Musks actual neo Nazi agenda vs Mercedes old German agenda lol. It's all a joke man.",0

Get it?",-1
16b72u1,Mercedes unveils new electric concept cars with better range than any Tesla model. Puts on TSLA?!,"1st some introduction to German politics, German law does not allow full autonomous driving, so the whole argument goes out the door. Mercedes has the sensors and some of the systems to enable such ideas but it's fair to say it is a long shot to have Mercedes roll out full autonomy tomorrow even if it were allowed.
2nd Mercedes focus the past decade has been on assisted driving, things like lane keeping assist, parking aid, highway cruise control so on and so forth. Through that Mercedes had a large focus on near proximity data and sensors, there is a reason why every drive assistant in modern cars will not go a significantly higher speed than 130 km/h, that's because the faster the vehicle is the further down the road the car has so analyse to make good decisions, the complications grow exponentially with increasing speed and Mercedes had a lot of catching up to do when Tesla first rolled out their version of drive assist because Mercedes focused way havier on the comfort applications of drive assist like parking and lane keeping. 
3rd criticism where criticism is due, Tesla is far away from perfect and some claims made by them are way out of proportion. On the other hand Mercedes has also had their fair share of trouble with driving assist (reminder to Mercedes first iteration of emergency breaking ...) Which led to countless accidents and vehicles called back to the dealership to update the software. Tesla should never have claimed autonomous driving capabilities no question on that front, in contrast it has become quite obvious that Tesla had some sever flaws as well as some oversights on their part eg. not utilizing lidar Sensor. 
All in all it's incorrect of either company to claim autonomous driving capabilities because both have had problems with their programs and as sophisticated as these systems are they can only recognize a situation that has occurred beforehand or they were programmed to deal with. That's also the point where both companies have already experienced turmoil, when their vehicles encounter situations that are not judgable or misinterpreted.",1
16b72u1,Mercedes unveils new electric concept cars with better range than any Tesla model. Puts on TSLA?!,"If Tesla is priced lower it competes for sure. Which is why they are dropping their prices.  


If Tesla is similarly priced to an established German competitor it absolutely does not. Look up Tesla build quality.",8
16b72u1,Mercedes unveils new electric concept cars with better range than any Tesla model. Puts on TSLA?!,"being priced the same doesn’t matter when you have to buy it through a dealer, there’s no guarantee Mercedes can keep up with demand, and there’s no charging network like Tesla’s Superchargers. Tesla is also rolling out an autopilot system trained on a supercomputer that no auto company would ever be able to build for the next decade.

The current mercedes electric vehicles are also riddled with problems and have been recalled multiple times due to software and hardware issues. No guarantee that this won’t have those problems either. I’d buy a BMW, Audi, or Porsche over Mercedes, even if there’s a slightly higher premium.",6

Bmw actually introduced some new color and materials in their line up with a finish that rivals Mercedes. 
On the other hand Tesla's cars especially on the higher end of the budget are also quite renounced nowadays - the model X and model Y are both huge cars rivaling the spaciousness of a GLE and the model S is comparable in dimensions to an amg bi turbo V8 sports coupé, might even be bigger. Now of course everyone always says ""but the build quality???"" And yes Tesla is not spending the same amount of money on the inside of the car as Mercedes is but a Mercedes with comparable stats dimension wise usually already runs you to at least 1.5 times the price and is the slight quality improvement on the inside really worth that amount of money ? And one could add that performance wise the race is not even close, Teslas do not have the best suspension granted but the handling of the cars are second to none, a model Y drives like an amg gt because of its low center of gravity, the electric motors enable an acceleration that is not comparable to combustion engines or any electric car Mercedes has on the road. The model S steps that performance gain up a notch and is really only rivaled by something like the rimac nevera (an electric hyper sports car that costs 20x the price of a model S). Tesla is still in a place where it rivals traditional car manufacturers. And Mercedes is really not as special on luxury in modern times among the ever increasing standards of quality and prestige in the car world, at least not as special as they used to be.",1

Just spent a whole day replacing a crank angle sensor on my Sienna, and I'm looking at at least another weekend worth of work on the steering.",1
16b72u1,Mercedes unveils new electric concept cars with better range than any Tesla model. Puts on TSLA?!,"I have to agree with you that up until now the gap in tech has been big enough to overshadow decisions based on image / reputation.

On the other hand it's evident that especially with cars there is huge brand value and people totally make decisions based on brand / image in addition to stats. Just talk to somebody that's interested in cars and suggest another comparable brand is better than theirs.

I didn't really base my comment on Reddit communities as much as on irl experience and you're right in that most of my friends are more left-leaning students. I'm aware that this isn't a cross-section of the general public.

However my partner's father is quite wealthy and through him I've talked to a lot of really well-off people, and I can assure you besides one person that owns a software company none of them would ever buy a Tesla, exactly for that reason. It's not that they're left-leaning, it's just that they don't like the image Tesla has and would instead buy a Taycan every day of the week if it has to be electric.

Obviously a Porsche is more expensive and not an option for a lot of Tesla buyers, but that's exactly where I believe Mercedes will come in. If it holds true, it's giving another good option in a price segment that was lacking in competition.",1

Meanwhile I’ve been driving with Autopilot literally all over the country at 80mph through all sorts of road conditions from torrential rain and blinding sunshine with complete autonomy and I’ve been doing this for the last 4 years.
