18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,He died in his office 4 iPhone generations ago. Nobody noticed until the new intern was fired for raising a concern the design hadn't changed for ages,3329
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,I love how they change the word retiring to leaving. Makes it sound much worse.,1872
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,I‚Äôd say he‚Äôs been coasting for a good while now,642
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,At least show how they flip back and forth between straight edges and curved edges lol.,564
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,Turns out he was phoning it in for years.,86
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,"You know what I hate?  When they change shit just to change it.  When you have something that works well, leave it the fuck alone unless you‚Äôre making a dramatic improvement.",349
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,This is why I still have my 12 pro max.,24
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,"Good riddance, hopefully who ever takes over designs away the god awful camera bump. I‚Äôd sacrifice a little weight for a flat back and extra battery. And with titanium they should be saving so much weight‚Ä¶",230
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,"Bro had the easiest job in the world. He could have retired 3 years ago and no one would have known.  The only significant change, the move to titanium, resulted in the weakest iPhone to date lmao",69
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,Seems he didn't do much for the last few years. Cost saving. Bam bam bam calls!,8
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,At least all the cases and screen protectors carry over.,73

18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,Why would someone even care what their phone looks like. They‚Äôre all just floating screens now. Worrying about the fashion of your phone is gay.,109
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,"Ok, but why is every model is this picture a 14 Pro? 12 Pro has a much smaller camera cutout, 13 Pro has a more yellow flash, and 15 Pro has a smaller top left lens and thinner metal bezel around the outside. At least they edited the color to sort of match the blue offered on the 15 Pro.",36
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,Oh no! How are they gonna make the same thing over and over again,4

18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,Apple proves how ridiculously stupid consumers in general are. I've had the same samsung for 4 years and THEY come our with new designs almost every year with new hardware. Apple understands their customers are all materialistic sheep.,6

18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,"And yet, I see iPhones everywhere.

18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,It's not just the iPhone.. you could also say the same about all of their other products since Steve Jobs passed away.,1

18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,Good,1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,"You know the pic is fake, right? I had all those phones. None of the same. They‚Äôre very easily distinguishable from each other.",1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,They are hiring the dude from EA Sports who somehow spits out the same FIFA and Madden games every year and still sells millions of units.,1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,"I'm pretty sure by design they mean the guy who designs the internals of the phone, not the actual physical aesthetic of the phone. Right?",1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,"So someone copied an iPhone 13 Pro ad to write numbers 12 to 15 on it to prove what?

I mean the camera is the only thing to distinct between those 4 models because it got bigger each time.",1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,Maybe the next individual will do something with titanium?,1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,I thought he manage to reduce the weight by 1 gram and it made with Titanium too.,1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,Looks like the same shit. Glad he‚Äôs gone.,1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,"I went from the 8 to the 14 pro max and that was actually a substantial increase. At this rate (unless Apple throttles), I‚Äôll be waiting until the 19 for any substantial change",1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,Good imo - Apple have dropped the ball majorly on iPhone design. For example Samsung has flip phones and patented the hell out of it. That is the future and Apple can‚Äôt even catch up. God I hate apple from a shareholder perspective ![img](emote|t5_2th52|31225)![img](emote|t5_2th52|27421),1

Will always remind me of shit old oven stove tops",1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,My opinion. If they put out a new design chances are there will be glitches so puts. If they keep the same old design people are going to be bored so puts. To be honest I just don't like apple.üòÜ,1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,Someone fell in love with their design,1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,Oh good we may finally have a phone that isn‚Äôt the same as before. Where‚Äôs the innovation?,1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,"Iphone design has got very similar to razor design. When you run out of ideas, just add another blade/camera. Iphone 20 is a must buy. Why though? IT HAS 13 FVCKING CAMERAS, THATS WHY!",1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,I don‚Äôt think people understand what a VP is.,1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,Thank the lord we get some innovation now,1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,Come on 16!,1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,Lol come on they‚Äôre similar but posting fake stuff is silly. The camera bump area is 100% not the same size across all 4 of these generations. This is just a promo shot of the same model.,1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,Yes the design didn‚Äôt change but the picture is bulshit too. The camera bump of the 12 pro was smaller than the 13 pro.,1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,"Love the design‚Ä¶ personally, i chose the one with the 3 cameras because it looked better than the other ones",1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,Hey that‚Äôs not fair. My 11 Pro Max looks identical too,1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,"Finally, it can look different than the last.",1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,I probably said the same about the blackberry design lol but I don‚Äôt how they can improve the current design,1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,"Good it‚Äôs ugly. lol I want a round phone shaped like a makeup case and have it be only 3‚Äù in diameter but it can withstand falls up to 4,500 meters and be able to be used in no oxygen",1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,Because it look f%king perfect. It can be like this forever whats ya all problem üòÇ It's not shitty Samsung or other chinese shiet,1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,They‚Äôll have to find someone else who can draw a rectangle.,1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,"I mean, this happens with a lot of design for fairly new products. Look at skateboards and snowboards for instance. When they were first thought up, no one really knew what people‚Äôs capability or needs would be with them. This led to wildly different and specialized attempts at designs as people started to figure it out, and competing brands would look totally different with each new innovation slowly making their way into all of the different products. Then, you basically reach an equilibrium where it‚Äôs more or less been figured out and the form-factor is clear. We are basically there with smartphones currently. The biggest question on the horizon right now: is bendable OLED tech robust enough for years of rugged use, so as not to be a roadblock for more compact foldable phones (or will people want this).",1

18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,judging by how much (or rather little) the products change from generation to generation  no one will notice his departure for quite some time,1
18ecxrr,Apple's head of iphone and Apple watch design leaving the company $AAPL,"There‚Äôs so much potential here for their design development:
 
- Remove the camera bumps

- Actually give the option for an SD card

- similar to androids, re introduce the option for a fingerprint scanner as part of the volume rocker or a side finger print scanner (I miss having the option)

- a headphone jack. It‚Äôs ridiculous, it‚Äôs 2023 and I have to use adaptors for everything to dual charge (listen to music while charging my phone in the car) amongst other silly inconveniences. It‚Äôs wild to me that the general public - mostly in USA I find - will defend it also. ‚ÄúOh well everything is Bluetooth just get a Bluetooth‚Äù the fact is when that fails and always does, the option for hardwired connection is always preferred. It‚Äôs very cheap to add a headphone jack and phones muchhhh cheaper than an iPhone today have one. 

The list goes on. But I need to keep my android tucked away because people complain too much about creating group chats and not being about to iMessage you if you‚Äôre not in the IOS community. The one and only reason I still have an iPhone is iMessage but it‚Äôs growing old. The convenience is nice of having an iPhone, but I prefer having an Android as my daily device. iPhone just makes it easier for me to communicate with family who live abroad and where I live the networks are terrible, wifi communication has saved us with iMessage. Especially for people who don‚Äôt have Facebook or won‚Äôt use what‚Äôsapp, I‚Äôve always appreciated imessage as a service. I wish it was an app available for use on Android. 

I miss having my android and the flexibility. I miss the battery life, even on $100-$200 android phones is better than an iPhone. I‚Äôm getting very tired of throwing away money on a new battery that dies out way too quickly and/or new hardware every couple of years I really don‚Äôt need but am forced into because the old devices start working less performance and battery wise. The devices are so expensive and don‚Äôt even have a headphone jack. 

It‚Äôs criminal at this point and beyond the iPhone 13, I don‚Äôt see myself getting a new iPhone not even the 15 any time soon. I‚Äôm upset they are also introducing ESIM beyond the 14 models. I‚Äôm okay with having a SIM card.",1
