18fe0a8,Sell or Hold $AAPL?,"One of the biggest mistakes people sometimes make is selling their winners too early.

18fe0a8,Sell or Hold $AAPL?,"When I doubled my money in my first $10k investment in AAPL, I thought to myself, ‚Äòawesome! I can sell it and buy something else!‚Äô But I looked around for something else I had more confidence in, and I couldn‚Äôt find anything. So I just left it in AAPL. That was 2005. I now have a few million in AAPL, and I‚Äôm very happy I didn‚Äôt cash out at 200%.  

(I want to add: the point here is not that AAPL will grow forever. It‚Äôs that if you have confidence in an investment don‚Äôt assume that 200% is all it will ever do for you. Investing is a long game, and you should be thinking more about where companies will be in 20 years than where they went in the last six months.)",256

My position has done incredibly well overall, but has gone through some serious dips on the way.  Sure it will probably go up more in the future, and if it does and I make slightly less money I am fine with that.  I have been super lucky with the investment and I would rather be somewhat protected against the next Covid or other black swan event.

There is literally zero indication that Apple has any revolutionary AI projects in the works. They were caught with their pants down when ChatGPT came out and now they are dumping tons of money into AI trying to catch up to the competition. Right now it seems like their major projects are to improve Siri and improve sentence auto-complete in iMessages using AI. They also have projects to add an equivalent of Github Copilot to Xcode, and some features for things like auto-generated playlists in Apple Music. They are already behind the competition in all of these areas, just dumping money into trying to avoid being left in the dust. None of these projects will bring in additional revenue, and if done poorly could severely hurt the Apple eco-system.

Basically at this point AI is a massive cost sink to Apple with no hope of profits in sight. AI is one of the worst things that could have happened to Apple, and it is a very real possibility that it could impact their bottom line in the long run. The Apple that was an innovator and disruptor in the tech space is long gone, dead with Steve Jobs.

This is the safer option to selling a ‚Äúnaked call‚Äù which is where you sell the option, but if the stock closes at the strike you sold the call for then you will have to buy 100 shares of that stock to cover your end of the bargain which is very expensive if you don‚Äôt have the cash.

If you sold a 195 strong call for next month expiration, you would get $490 in premium for every contract. Thats 2.5% return on $19,500 of stock for one month which I consider a good return. 

The risk in this situation is that your will limit your gains for Apple if it closes above $195 a share by next month. But the call will cover your up to $200/share. If it closes below $195 you will not have to sell the shares.

If you‚Äôre up $50k on 200% return then I‚Äôm assuming you probably have around 130 shares at $50/share? In that case you‚Äôre essentially risk free on your money until the stock so you shouldn‚Äôt be concerned if the option gets exercised and you have to sell it",6

I followed the presentation and there was nothing of real substance there. They talked about things like how fuzzy their fake leather is. That's a joke.

I used Android phones with iPhones and always came back to iPhones. What has made my switch permanent is the Google Pixel 7. At that point Google and Android has become very good. I use a Samsung S7Plus tablet and now with Dex 6 it is utterly incredible. 

The only Apple devices I still use are their notebooks and mac mini. Those were when I purchased them very good value and very affordable if you do an apples to apples comparison. But with the last release of  the new Macbook Pros I realized that I will be switching computers sometime in the future. They are overpricing their stuff and that is wrong. 

What I am saying is that Apple is sitting on its laurels way too long. Tim Cook is great when it comes to being a bean counter. But his innovation track record sucks. I can understand why Ives left. The culture has changed and Cook needs to go.

There are a lot of flaws with that thinking. 

Tech stocks went up 20% because they lost that much the year before. Look at AMZN  or Google over 5 years.

If you do fundamental analysis, their chance of future growth isn't that big. They trade often at high valuations, just because they are big. If you think their business model is a chance for growth and the price is justified, buy. But don't buy because they are big, tech and just made up 30% they lost before.

VOO Holdings:

AAPL - 6.96%

MSFT - 6.49%

Googl - 2.15%

INTC - 0.41%

AMZN - 3.19%

So you would be buying an ETF which holds all the stocks you would be buying.  What does that accomplish?  Answer: Nothing.

Nah. Realistically the censorship isn't going to actually drive many people away. It's really to make the perform more ad friendly. If they get serious about blocking ad blockers that will also be a nice boost to RPU and reduce costs a little bit. And YouTube premium is growing very fast.

One of the things that fascinates me is how such a behemoth of a company grew to that size without making anything. I have never owned a physical product made by google. They are far from market leaders in the enterprise sector (AWS, Azure, Salesforce) but yet their business productivity suite continue to chug along. I have never paid for youtube and haven't paid a dime for my gmail account that is old enough to apply for a driver's license. It boggles my mind how much money a search engine, user data collection and targeted ad revenue can balloon. Truly some peak consumerism sht.

People have said I'm crazy for this take, but what would google do in a recession? A real recession or even prolonged stagflation. The first thing that falls is the advertising industry. If you think about it Google doesn't produce or own much of anything that isn't completely codependent on advertising revenue. People I've had this thought experiment with are quick to say that google owns the biggest media content platform ever. They aren't wrong, that ship could drink a lot of water before it would ever sink, but that platform has been a cash cow only by the merciful teet of advertising dollars. Google no doubt must know this. I think their recent initiative in attempt to get in on the short video format space that no one wants and even more recent initiative to convert users with Adblockers on youtube to convert them in to premium subscribers could be a tell future projections on what was once reliable revenue streams might be slowing down. By no means do I think google would be doomed they are a lot more than just youtube, but from an investing standpoint I could never justify entering a position after the great slingshot of covid 19.

First and foremost, at the consumer level we have a watered down version of utilizing current advancements in AI for our own musings through things like ChatGPT, Dall-E, etc.

I do not think that this is where the market is heading, but giving plebs like us a few new toys to mess with isn't creating any real harm.

Most big tech companies have what would be considered just a couple decades past a monopoly. The reason we don't hear much of startups in this space is they are literally just acquired and gobbled up by the big players in the space as soon as something innovative hits the market. Apple is acquiring companies at a rate of about 90 per annum, you can view Google's more recent acquisitions [on Wiki](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mergers_and_acquisitions_by_Alphabet) which details a severe market uptick in AI, analytics, and robotics.

Unless you are an ""insider"" you probably won't hear too much on these advancements, as big tech acquires most of these companies before they come to market for an end user.

If you want to look at what technologies AI is being used for, look no further than CIA funding. Palantir is a decent example of a CIA funded startup that is now publicly traded.

You can also look at a CIA finance arm's offerings [here](https://www.iqt.org/portfolio/). Occasionally looking at the startups there, a certain air of dystopian future can arise.

Big data, big analytics, and big surveillance are a despot's wet dream, and as more developing nations increase internet access for their populations, these tools will become even more pervasive.

Not all redundancies in big tech will come directly from AI, but automation of historically human jobs is certainly in the pipeline. One needs to look no further than their local supermarket in the western world to see machines fulfilling the past roles of cashiers. 

It is speculated that Microsoft is using individual user data to train it's [AI models](https://mspoweruser.com/personal-data-to-train-ai/) after a recent change in their privacy policy.

While we may not see the ramifications of these moves for a couple years, it's safe to assume that big tech wielding such an extensive collection of user data that can be parsed through AI models is going to be seriously fucking lucrative, likely at the expense of the general public.

If you want a glimpse of the dystopian promiseland envisioned by big tech and government, check out Henry Kissinger and former Google CEO Eric Schmidt's book ""The Age of AI.""
