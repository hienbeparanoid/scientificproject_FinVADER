18hzuzp,Opinions?,"First of all congratulations on starting early.  You will thank yourself. Good job.  Second at your age if you just concentrate on broad ETFs that is the best path for most.  You will hear this over and over. If it were me I would just invest the $5 per day in VTI, VOO or VT.  SPY is very good but the others i mentioned have lower expenses.  I don’t think you need any JEPY at your age. The rest of these companies may well turn a profit but you have time on your.  $100 per month in one of the ETFs above will work wonders with compound growth.  If you want a little more tech exposure you could look at QQQM in addition or VXUS for international. It boring investing that way but it works.  I would check out r/bogleheads if you are interested in this way of investing.  Just my 2 cents but you will probably hear the same here.  Good luck.",11
18hzuzp,Opinions?,Put it all in VOO and you’ll be good,3
18hzuzp,Opinions?,Put all your money in ONE single S&P 500 ETF,3

18hzuzp,Opinions?,"Don't know if I would stay in LCID much longer , their outlook isn't very good if what I read somewhere is the case.(low on cash it seems)

Although a lot of people are skeptical of Chinese stocks , I would seriously consider getting Nio if you are into EV stocks, IF you can get it for 7€ or less per stock.

This is if you aren't looking to hold for a long time though, but as of now you can probably squeeze out a solid 10 to 20% profit in the near term with relative certainty with the current price point of the stock. ( Sentiment on Nio is very mixed at the moment , but hopefully ""Nio days"" at the end of the month can change that to be more positive)

Don't take my word for it tho, as stocks are a finicky thing and I'm most certainly no professional.",0

18hzuzp,Opinions?,"Are you investing , looking for income , or just throwing money into anything ? What direction are y you looking for ?",1
18hzuzp,Opinions?,do you think I divid that 100 into 4 different ETFs and it would be better? Or should I stick to a single one?,2
18hzuzp,Opinions?,I have one of the _yld funds.  I'm hoping to sell at my break even point.  My question is why is their so much hype around these funds?  It's sounds interesting but I'm not buying anymore.  Remember nusi?  So much love for these funds and I'm not sure why.,1
18hzuzp,Opinions?,I will! I had a lot of suspicions on it cause it seemed a lil too good too be true!,1
18hzuzp,Opinions?,"I took a 16 hour SIE class and we went over options, I dabbled a little bit and I lost a pretty penny (50$ dollars) but I see the crazy profits that can emerge from them.",3
18hzuzp,Opinions?,"If it were me and I knew what I know now at your age I would put all $100 per month in VTI or VOO.  These are very diversified funds.  There are over 3,700 stocks in VTI alone.  I put the link below for the top 50 holdings.  I think it is a better strategy than what you have above but I am just 1 person. I am 49 and I can tell you this strategy has worked well for me and I will be able to retire early. Once I got a solid base in a broad based fund (FXAIX in my 401k, equivalent of VOO) I branched out a little to include VXUS, QQQM and BND.   I don’t think you need bonds at your age.  
Like I said SPY is also a great choice but has a little higher fees.  
Just remember investing at your age you can’t do much wrong by picking good individual companies but I believe a broad ETF is the ticket.  I would build a solid base in 1 and then branch out as you age.  Just 1 man’s opinion.  I wish you luck. 

https://stockanalysis.com/etf/vti/holdings/",1
18hzuzp,Opinions?,"I would say you should choose a combination of VOO (big caps), QQQ (tech heavy, overvalued), VNQ (real estate, significantly undervalued but benefit the most when interest rate drops next year), XLF (finance), XLE (energy, high dividend, good for diversified), XLI (industrial), BIL (short-term government bond, no risk, 5.2% annual return guaranteed). 

Basically, instead of choosing individual stocks, you should invest sector ETFs that you believe will benefit the most given the macroeconomic conditions. Given interest rate will drop next year, tech and real estate will benefit the most. But tech sector is already priced in to some extent, so real estate is the best place to invest. 

Ideal portfolio: 50% QQQ, 50% VNQ

18hzuzp,Opinions?,Do NOT listen to this. A lot more people lose money buying options than those that make money. Stick with index funds as others have mentioned. Do NOT take any advice from WSB. In fact don’t even read that unless you just want to laugh at comments. 1/2 of it is fake and the other 1/2 is idiots. And I would recommend dumping CGC and taking the tax break. It’s never going to be a winner.,2

Could it match Tesla? That's a pipe dream. Could it replicate 1/5th of Tesla's success and still be one of the best opportunities out there currently? Still unlikely, but at least plausible. 


I used to sell covered calls on my shares. I think the potential for sudden growth is better than the meager premiums collected. I remain neutral to slightly bullish if for no other reason than there seems to be more upside potential than downside risk left. It would be too much an embarrassment for the National Party to let NIO fail, and it isn't like there is much else in China that seems particularly attractive for growth investors currently.",4

So yes, in China they will put more EVs into the market, but they still are not even close to matching Tesla's profits in China.

As I pointed out, ALL Chinese makers combined still do not make as much profit in China as Tesla makes in China, alone.
