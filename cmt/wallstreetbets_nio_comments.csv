>TL;DR: NIO is a great company that is currently undervalued. They have a clear vision, a diverse team of talented individuals, and their cars are priced reasonably. I‚Äôm bullish on NIO and believe that the stock price will increase in the next few years.",1

18difix,Why NIO Inc is Undervalued,>I agree that NIO is undervalued. I think people are underestimating the company's potential and its ability to innovate.,10

18difix,Why NIO Inc is Undervalued,"NIOs battery swapping plan is flawed at best and couldn't be implemented in most countries due to theft and vandalism concerns.

Plus, I'm just uncomfortable sticking my dick in Pooh bears honey. There's far too much risk of government interference.",9

18difix,Why NIO Inc is Undervalued,Let go of the bag üíº,3
18difix,Why NIO Inc is Undervalued," **Why NIO valuation is useless**

1/ NIO is chinese, thus the party can feck any ""investor"" anytime it wants.

2/ NIO is chinese, so their books are cooked.

3/ You are getting shares of an ADR. It says it has NIO shares, and gives you exposure to it. You have no guarantee whatsoever that it does and will.",2

Elmo is riding Xi's d real hard, NIO has no chance without commie party putting Tesla into gulag.",1
18difix,Why NIO Inc is Undervalued,Because they went with swappable batteries which is stupid. Elon had the vision to go with superchargers. Easiestly one of the most pivotal decisions in the EV industry.,0
18difix,Why NIO Inc is Undervalued,"You clearly don‚Äôt understand *why* people would buy a battery swap enabled car. Most things with humans is not logical. It‚Äôs emotional. 

Most of us here are dudes, just by the statistics of stock trading. So most of us don‚Äôt have any problems emotionally or physically handling fast charging cables. But if you are a tiny little woman, and you see yourself as feminine emotionally, wielding big, rigid, heavy and sometimes dirty charging cables is not what you want to do. What about battery swap? You sit in your car and it does it fully automatically in 4 minutes.

As anybody here knows who have a relationship with a woman, you know that just because they can do something, doesn‚Äôt mean that they won‚Äôt pay to not do that thing even though it makes absolutely no logical sense.

And then there is the other aspect: Time. Where would your woman like to be? At the supercharger for 30 minutes, or at home 30 minutes earlier? And with the kids in the back asking ‚Äúwhen can we be home??‚Äù what does your woman think of that? I think she thinks ‚Äúit would sure be nice if the kids could be home at the house instead sitting here‚Äù.

Why is the blue bubble on iPhones a thing that you‚Äôd pay $800 more for?
Why does girls who care NADA about technology need the newest iPhone 15 Pro Max 256GB?
Why did the sale of Model Y literally explode once some women saw other women in families buy it?

Buying a product is an emotional decision. These are cars made for families, and who signs off on the big purchase decisions in *most* families?

But here‚Äôs the problem: Your woman need to have experienced the supercharger cable situation. The 30-60 minute charge session. And then she needs to know about or experience the battery swap. And THATS Nio‚Äôs biggest problem at this point (IMO).

You regards talk in features while you should have been in your feelings.

Glorious CCP Position: 1000 shares at $7.21",-8
18difix,Why NIO Inc is Undervalued,"I feel like hot swapping batteries is a HUGE boon for ev‚Äôs as a concept, but just doesnt seem to be catching on.

If we could standardise the batteries we can just have unmanned swap stations spaced every 200km or so, cover the entire world, and nobody ever runs out of power.

Hell they can probably be restocked by fleets of robots driving self driving cars too.  The entire energy distribution backbone is touch free and fully automated.

We could just about manage this with current technology, but theres no way in shit we‚Äôre all going to formalise a single battery standard for ev‚Äôs.

Maybe in the eu in 20 years?",-2

18difix,Why NIO Inc is Undervalued,But do you prefer Rivian the company?,2
18difix,Why NIO Inc is Undervalued,"Not disagreeing, but battery issue is a higher alert than the catalytic converter. Tampering with it, would be dangerous‚Ä¶ and you know that it would be abused to oblivion here in the US, then swap for new battery and whoever gets the old one would be left with a bomb.",2
18difix,Why NIO Inc is Undervalued,I CAN‚ÄôT wait for this shit to go to ZERO,1
18difix,Why NIO Inc is Undervalued,"Not planning, they try and fail. For example in europe/germany.
China is now a knock out battle. Good luck to fight the price reductions from Tesla and BYD with a vision",6
18difix,Why NIO Inc is Undervalued,I will you the best of luck. I‚Äôm too paper hands to touch the Chinese EV market but there‚Äôs definitely money to be made if you‚Äôre lucky.,1
18difix,Why NIO Inc is Undervalued,I like NIO but the oversea strategy of NIO is mostly market it in China IMHO,1
18difix,Why NIO Inc is Undervalued,"You can't hedge like that. It makes you bad at both. Tesla committed to superchargers and excelled in that execution. The same thing with Toyota hedging with hybrids...you turn out an inferior product that's neither excellent at A nor B. Traditionally, I feel US companies and CEOs have been more forward thinking and aggressive in their vision which has been the key to their successes. When you try to be  a jack of all trades, you're master of none.

My biggest gripe 10 years ago with EVs has been range anxiety for road trips. Tesla has virtually eliminated that. There is a Tesla charger literally everywhere.",1
18difix,Why NIO Inc is Undervalued,He is just an idiot rambling nonesense,2
18difix,Why NIO Inc is Undervalued,"Incels *don‚Äôt* fuck dude, that‚Äôs the whole point.",1
18difix,Why NIO Inc is Undervalued,whatever you say mate,1
18difix,Why NIO Inc is Undervalued,"You can love something that's poorly designed until of course that designs flaws show. 

Take a look at a Rivian and notice it's humongous one piece panels that cover large surface areas of the vehicle. 

You won't be able to replace those if they're damaged with cost efficiency. Insurance companies are going to want to total the vehicle. It's already happening.",1
18difix,Why NIO Inc is Undervalued,"Yes, I like the R1 platform.
Let's see how they do with R2.",2
18difix,Why NIO Inc is Undervalued,Thank you üòä play all your life savings into a huge put. Let's see who wins?,1
18difix,Why NIO Inc is Undervalued,"Ngl touching anything based in or on China in the stock market is like setting your balls over fire to get rid of your pubes 

Like yeah it may work but you‚Äôre really risking a lot needlessly",1
18difix,Why NIO Inc is Undervalued,"You're right, the overseas strategy of NIO is mostly to market it in China. However, I believe that there is still a lot of potential for growth in other markets as well.",1
18difix,Why NIO Inc is Undervalued,"There's no issues supercharging a NIO though. So I'm scratching my head as to what problem you're pointing out. 

Do you have anything I can reference? Because the charging time for a NIO and for a Tesla is the same depending on the charger.",1
18difix,Why NIO Inc is Undervalued,"I agree, the R1 platform is impressive. I am curious to see how the R2 platform will fare.",0
18difix,Why NIO Inc is Undervalued,Agree but specifically for NIO it‚Äôs harder to scale as they need to establish the power swap infrastructure at the same time as they need to push sales. BYD or others just can sell cars :) so I have a hard time believing the moat of NIO (if you consider the swap as one) is highly limited to domestic market imho,1
18difix,Why NIO Inc is Undervalued,"Lmao. That the biggest and most versatile network is owned by a different company, your rival.  That's not a big issue? Lmao.",2
18difix,Why NIO Inc is Undervalued,Any EV can use Tesla's supercharger. They in fact encourage it as they make money just like gas stations do.,1
18difix,Why NIO Inc is Undervalued,Sure but you are beholden to your rival. That's a big flaw.,2

Walmart wanted to follow the below-cost strategy, but the German business owners didn‚Äôt like Walmart‚Äôs low-cost pricing tactic as well as the German government. As a result, the American giant was ordered to raise its prices by the German high court which became an obstacle for it to having a customer base. Walmart and German unions were incompatible. In Germany, unlike in the US, unions are very much a part of the culture and have broad support amongst the government, the community, and even businesses. Walmart didn‚Äôt understand that in Germany, companies and unions are closely connected. Also, The German workforce is accustomed to negotiating their pay with their union. This caused friction between the workers and the company. When Walmart refused to join Germany‚Äôs regional wage bargaining system, the worker‚Äôs union went on strike.

‚ÄúFirst, government incentives have made EVs the best financial choice for consumers. Norwegians who buy all-electric vehicles do not have to pay high value-added taxes or registration taxes and receive other financial benefits as well.‚Äù


‚ÄúSecond, the government has invested heavily in EV chargers and as a result Norway has the most public fast chargers per capita of any country in the world. These can get an EV battery from zero to 80% in as little as 20 minutes. In addition, Norway has established a right to charge for people living in apartment buildings and provides grants for housing associations to install their own chargers.

Third, Norway has also provided EV owners with some attractive perks, such as free parking in cities, exemptions or reductions in road tolls, access to priority bus lanes and reduced rates for EVs to be transported by ferry (ferries are frequently used given Norway‚Äôs fjord-covered landscape).

Just like how Meta has the worst possible ESG score available, because they have the Cambridge Analytica case. Not many peers have that kind of case against them.

The reason the unions are fighting hard is because that's why they exist. To force companies to fall in line to Swedish worker demands.

[Sweden is among the most unionized countries in the world](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1356735/labor-unions-most-unionized-countries-worldwide/) with 65.7% of the workforce unionized. You can't just ignore that if you want to last here.

Everyone else does too. The 23 000 SEK is a floor for newbies the times when there isn't a high demand.

Ignoring the fact that the USA would like to pay a premium to not be tied to a Russian system. Sure not every launch needs that capacity, but even if it's only at 1/4 load it's still competitive, and probably still the most reliable.  


Your numbers are also a bit wonky. So fuel in rockets is the cheap part of them compared to everything else, and weight of payload is far more the limiting factor for fuel usage than reuse. So yeah reusing the rocket cuts the amount of payload it can carry, however the falcon 9 can carry way more than all but the ULAs Atlas V, in it's weight group. And the Atlas V costs over 40million more to launch currently. The ones even bigger than that cost astronomical amounts and are rarely used. Which the Falcon 9 heavy crushes in both max weight liftable and expected cost.",1

18ch3n7,Danish pension funds (43 billion USD) starts selling TSLA stocks due to labor union dispute,"It works and particular markets mainly when interest rates are low not so much when the rubber meets the road... It's a different strategy and quite honestly different skill set.

I guess my point is Tesla is absolutely leader innovator FrontRunner of electric vehicles 1,000.
But if you're baking in way higher valuations from the othe stuff  I'm not so sure about when I really look under the hood. 

But hey if you can PR it and ride the hype based on your bankers or consultants advice more power to you doesn't mean I think it's going to be like that forever",6

""Musk is a genius at marketing""

""Almost every news outlet, every YT channel, every auto review..."" is talking about Elon and Tesla. Check out Google Trends. Not just the Cybertruck. This whole ""antisemitism accusations"" ordeal. Every time the media shits on X or Elon you're increasing his power.

The amount of news coverage Tesla is going to get from this event for free is the the genius at marketing. Tesla and Elon being hated generates clicks. You click on the articles. You talk about it on social media. People know his name and products because you go around complaining about them.

The media associate Tesla and Elon articles with clicks. You guys are a bunch of trained monkeys working for Musk and you don't even realize it.
