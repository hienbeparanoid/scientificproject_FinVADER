1abv5ee,Routine Analysis of TSLA,2024-01-27 08:56:16,"Hahaha. You obviously know very little about economic fundamentals that drive stock prices. You aren't paying attention when you say almost no competition ahead.

Tesla has cut vehicle prices 3 times in 2023 due to losing market share due to competition. It's people like you who lose substantial sums of money in the stock market because you think,  but don't know basic fundamentals and economics. 

Knock yourself out.",-3

Imagine having to sit in your car for an hour in a blizzard.  At least it would be well heated inside.

3. BABA still leads with Alipay, yes the retail aspect is losing market share. Do note that these other companies are offering discounts after discounts to get market share. Once the discounts are gone how can you undercut BABA?
4. BABA as a whole might not be around 5 years later, but the payment system is hard to beat in China when digital wallets are the normal. BABA allows you to use foreign account digitally to pay when in China. The Chinese do not jump ship that easily, hence why Apple Pay is not super popular in China. Alipay has a Google like effect in China and has more room to run. 
5. Jack Ma will not let his company fail, he’s acting in the shadows for his family’s safety. He’s still calling the shots at BABA and biding his time.

3) At the same time, the buyback program has been ongoing since 2021, but that didn’t stop the shares from depreciating even more. 
4) The founder Jack Ma is leaving Alibaba
5) The negative market reaction to Alibaba’s latest earnings results indicates that the new geopolitical reality with heightened macro risks will continue to be more important for investors than the company’s fundamentals. What’s more, is that it appears that there’s nothing that the company’s management can do to change the situation.

Okay. You are saying Twitter turned a profit for a couple of years and not others because of legal troubles. This was during the biggest economic boom in recent memory. 0% ffr, everyone trapped in their houses increasing Internet usage, and lots of helicopter money. Now it's been a year and the script has flipped. We have a 5% ffr and economic conditions are restrictive. What kind of quarterly loss are they taking right now? 

>His other companies are successful because they've attracted great talent and then built up a layer of management to manage Elon - run with his good ideas and ignore his bad ideas. 

This could very well be true. I don't work directly for him so I have no idea. That said, whatever methodology he uses, it's been extremely successful. 


>He is like a virus, and those companies had time to grow an immune response to him.

Don't think this is a fair statement.  Virus implies he is net negative. If that was the case and companies were being successful despite him damaging, then ceo would be a meaningless position. Why aren't other companies pulling Jon Does off the street to build trillion dollar companies... Why is it that whenever he gets involved, amazing companies are built...

>At Twitter, he fired all of the experts and he's just flailing around digging the hole deeper.

You mean he cut all the fat and brought out his own software people to review the product? Did he cut to much initially? Yes. Was this type of change needed for success? Also yes. The company was hemorrhaging money. 


At the end of the day, I'm very happy that he was willing to take the platform over. He has provided a town square that might not be perfect, but is far better than anything else around.

FSD V12 looks super impressive, and crosses a barrier in terms of the entire approach. The switch to neural nets really is a game changer and I can't see how any other company could catch Tesla on this. The build quality, materials, and charging speeds of the cars are comparable.  
  
The optimus robots have some of the most impressive hardware we've seen from any robotics company.

Tesla is also yet to address the largest vehicle market, yet they still have the best selling car globally. A more affordable compact will boost sales to meet the forecast growth.

I think we need to find another market that utilizes what we have learned so far. What will most likely happen is that AI will reveal new usecases that will produce new markets. The last 20 years of digital innovation is a technological revolution that has changed the world so much that I sometimes feel like my childhood in the 90s was a different life. To see the same growth again, we need another technological revolution, but I doubt it will be in entertainment and work productivity which is the primary driver for the past 20 years of technological advancements. But there are plenty of markets that have yet to be modernised with the technology we have today. Example; personal health, psychology, education, finance, to name a few. 

Here is an example of a product I would pay for; a monthly subscription to get AI to analyse my body metrics in order to give me health feedback, discover sickness or cancer early and generally help me make good decisions before a doctor tells me im sick. 

Another product I would pay for is something like Blueprint by Bryan Johnson which is health and food guides that atleast seem to not be based on bullshit, because 9/10 health-meal companies sell you a scam product for profit. 

An important product that we have forgotten about since corona is green energy. A lot of these companies have been beaten to death by the markets, yet the problem it wants to solve still persists. If we dont do anything than 5 years from now when we are close to he 2030 deadline, a lot of people will get a reality check. Cant become a stock market millionaire or billionaire if half the world is in flames due to constant natural disasters. 

Finally, the digital age has brought with it a quantized world. I think the next step is to bring individual quality into the mix. There are plenty of areas where the individual quality has died out the past 30 years. Education, medical help, psychological help, societal empathy, just to name a few. Research is showing that from a human aspect of health, especially mental health, we are in a not very good spot currently. So whoever figures out how to modernize and digitalize quality improvements in human wel-being will have a really strong moat for becoming a giant billion dollar company. 

Generallty, I think the past 15 years has showed a lot of people that you cant really trust any big company. META and GOOGLE has more or less built empires on using people as revenue. Food industry has been screwing up the general public for over 50 years now, and the health of nature is on a thin lifeline. Zoomers and millenials are generally much more health oriented, working out more, eating healthier and paying more for environmentally friendly options. I think a big market driver in the future will be in products that sell quality, honesty and health to this generation.",4

Dude I know you're a Cardowno holder and all, but surely you can see how you contradict yourself right there.

If NVDA has a pattern of going up to $500 and then dropping, and then retesting $500 and then dropping again.....

Then even an ADA fanboy such as yourself must realize that means buying less then $500 (like $480 for example, in case you don't know how numbers work) would be the smart play. Not waiting until it's $500 to buy. 

Since... You know..... The $500 price is where NVDA generally peaks.

I know this is a hard concept for someone who buys dog themed fake internet money to understand, but an investor is supposed to buy low and sell high. 

Not buy NVDA when it's at a record high and then sell when it inevitably drops down in price

Hence the price doesn’t move because it’s not using our shares, it’s 1 institution to another. It’s also very beneficial for the seller to sell like this, so they don’t get slippage. Usually any large order will have slippage as you don’t have enough demand so you have to sell/ buy at a worse price. This removes that pressure and allows for a better trade",3

1ac2alg,"TSLA: ""No floor""",2024-01-27 15:45:06,"Okay so I want to give some input here from just fifteen minutes of research since I am seeing a lot of shit being tossed around without any data, and ontop of that I have $600 in tesla calls for next month so I want to see for myself.

To clarify, I am not wanting to really buy Tesla around this price, currently. I think sentiment sucks, I think Elon could potentially find means to crater the stock. I think there is *a lot* to root for in this company, but the sharks of issues surrounding it means I would rather wait to see if there is a large discount after we potentially see a correction in the broader market.

Short term, however, I believe we see a large bounce, as one does in Tesla when it hits these levels of oversold on the hourly timeframe. We are talking <15 RSI on the 4h chart, and oversold on the Daily, more then 25% below the 200MA. There's a lot of calls here for a strong bounce >200 and possibly to 230 before the month is over. It's happened **many** times before with Tesla, and will likely happen again.

**That being said, lets look at then numbers.**

I see plenty of people here talking about how Tesla is doomed now and is ""just another car company now"" because BMW and Cadillac are both making EVs, which are both getting to Level 3 autonomous driving before Tesla. But just googling for five minutes will tell you that both of these companies are nowhere near positioned to overtake Tesla, and if anything they are in a better position for Tesla to just simply buy them out to shut them up.

These are all TTM for 2023, and I am simply going to just look at the range of prices for each companies **cheapest** EV options.

**Tesla**

Operating Margins - 14.3%

Tesla cars sold - 1.8 MILLION

Cheapest EV - Model 3 - $38 to $50k

Operating margin per vehicle - $5300 - $7150

**Cadillac**

Operating Margin - 6.98% **<<< Half of Tesla's operating margin**

Cars Sold TTM - 147k **<<< Less then 90% of Tesla's volume**

Cheapest EV - Lyriq - $57 to $61k **<<< 22% - 47%  More expensive than Tesla**

Operating margin per vehicle - $3970 - $4250 per Lyriq (?)

**BMW**

BMW Margins - 17.58% **<<< Better then Tesla**

Cars sold TTM - 360k <<< **Less then 70% of Tesla's volume**

BMW i4 - $52,200 - $61600 <<< **22% - 36%  more expensive then TEsla**

Operating margin per vehicle $9000 - $10829 <<< **Better then Tesla**

So, yeah, BMW makes more profit per vehicle but their volume is astoundingly less then Tesla, Tesla simply has the factories and the verticals to support their tremendous growth. And on top of that, Teslas are MUCH cheaper then both these two examples which I am seeing brought up multiple times in this chat.

Level 3 driving is great, but at least for BMW it's going to cost $6000 to install. What if Tesla decides to simply include it in their most expensive model trim at cost? It's going to be like $70k to get Level 3 in a BMW when a Tesla will let you have it for $55k? It's a no brainer. You buy Tesla.

I'm not even going to go into the charger stations. No ""car company"" is going to try and compete in that space. Tesla owns 58% of the charging station market. Any of these companies trying to compete against Tesla are still feeding into Tesla's margins because they will depend on them to charge their vehicles. Just wait until you see a day when traditional gas stations start implementing EV chargers throughout the midwest. Tesla will be the go-to.

Listen, i'm not a Tesla shill. But even outside of charging stations and EV vehicles, their other verticals still make billions and you don't even hear about them. So just be thankful when there's a dip because there is good reason to see Tesla being a 1 trillion dollar company this decade.

Edit: I also want to add, with Cadillac and BMW we don't even really know the margins for their EV line up yet. It will take at least a year until we can be confident that they are actually breaking any ground in profitability, or if they are straight up taking a loss at these prices.",18

If we're above value you short + sell calls.  If we're below value, you buy shares and sell puts. You can look a Vega which is implied vol. And try to make estimates on how far the market is pricing in future price moments and you can make informed trading decisions.  Is implied vol pricing in a 2% move, but the monthly VPOC IS 4% away in price? Then long volatility and short Theta.

Not Financial Adivce. High conviction play.

&#x200B;

1x Tesla is currently a horrendous value play in the short term to medium term due to speculative long term growth catalysts.

2. Tesla was expected to grow 50% over year next year.

3x Cars overpriced as shit compared to increasingly similar market counterparts. Hyundai Ioniq and Ford get similar milage

4x) Growth estimates started changing sometime in q3. Now currently expected 15% growth in revenue. Possible

5x) Other cars are expected, to grow fast in self driving.

6) Used cars saturating market.

7)Macro risks - CC/student loans(payments just started) at all time highs. Unemployment ticking up. Market at all time highs carried by chips. Fed rate hike lag effect.

8) Elon wants more shares

9) Sales causing more margins to reduce.

10) Losing marketshares overseas rapidly to china. BYD is oging to be a killer once it gets Auto driving.

People seem to focus on short term results, pitches around EPS, deliveries, FSD, Elon talking sh\*t.  But in reality...

Tesla is not a car company.  It is not even a tech company.

It is above all a makers company.   Invent, make, repeat.   If they can make it once, they can make it a million times.

They have patents.  They have engines, materials, batteries, heatpumps, they made an entire OS, they build their own chips, if there is no electromotor avaible for robots, it's no big deal, they will build one of their own, actuators, robots,  even processors and chips, not to mention AI.  And they know something about real estate and building stuff on a worldwide scale (factories, TSC), they have international awareness and presence.  It is a diversified stock in its own right and not a a stock from a risky niche EV car maker.  They are financially solid (7,3% debt to equity, any other ""carmaker""?).

It's a damn shame Americans do not endorse this gem more than they do now.

2 - technical analysis on this level, as in looking for chart patterns, is mostly worthless.

3 - this is a downtrend. lower highs, lower lows. nothing about this says its going to pop off. in fact until you make a higher high and probably confirm it with a higher low the downtrend remains intact.

if you wanted to buy in you should wait until you make a higher high than the previous high, then on the pull back you buy. 

but buying now is just speculating. youre just hoping it goes up. sure maybe it will go back up in a lower high. maybe thats what you mean about ""moon""",1

Ironically, Elon hadn't really accomplished a whole lot at that time, whereas he's become the childish business tycoon that Iron Man's character ultimately is.

The biggest automotive companies are trading at roughly 3-8 PE. Sure, Tesla had amazing growth in the past, but in the last one or two years they could only manage to roughly keep up their growth by significantly cutting margins and also 'saving money' by throwing out fundamental parts like parking sensors (which basically most mid- to premium cars had since the 2000'-s) from their cars. When Tesla-s growth slows down to the growth of other manufacturers (and this is a question of when, not if) then their PE will also come down to the 3-10 range. The only question is, when will this happen? I think that in the next 2-4 years or so, so at a PE of 60 they are still significantly overvalued and they may never reach their ATH again (or they might, but maybe in a couple of decades from now)",32

They just have a charging port. So like, it will be revenue but it will be arbitrage like gas stations. And gas stations are BARELY profitable when it comes to selling gas, more often than not scraping by or losing money. All the money in a gas station is made in the convenience store. So, not quite the W you think it is.


Tesla giving up it's chargers was actually a huge L since that was a massive asset to their brand.",5

But honestly Netflix has no ads, I just pay for it because it's there when I randomly decide I need background noise and there's no ads. I looked at other streaming but all of them have ads no matter what, or are ridiculously obnoxious (Disney+) and won't let me use it with VPN so just went back to the high seas.",1
19esf27,$TSLA earnings be trash,2024-01-25 22:17:36,"I'm referring to charging. Gas stations are barely profitable for independent owners and franchisees, not the franchise or company. 

Gas stations also require employees, gas storage, more land, etc.

Tesla doesn't franchise any of it out. They're getting government dollars to build them, while other manufacturers are switching to their port.

They also don't pay for the property or the electricity to charge them, so every charge is profit for Tesla.

It's not an L to their brand. It's a massive win for their company as we inch closer to EV becoming the dominant vehicle on roads.",0
19esf27,$TSLA earnings be trash,2024-01-25 22:48:55,"So, total Tesla rev was 95B.


Total supercharger rev was 88M so less than one percent.


They are owners of the charger but none of the land, when typicallyt that is the greatest asset, so there's that. They don't seem to be paying to place the chargers yet, but that will come likely. 


Still not seeing the massive W you seem to think is happening here.",4
19esf27,$TSLA earnings be trash,2024-01-25 23:43:06,">Total supercharger rev was 88M so less than one percent.


>They don't seem to be paying to place the chargers yet, but that will come likely.

Revenue will continue to grow as more EVs are sold and more charging stations built.

Currently, only 9% of vehicles in the US are EV. 

Paying for charging station construction won't come until well after the infrastructure has been established and built.",-1
19esf27,$TSLA earnings be trash,2024-01-25 23:48:50,"Assuming, of course, that as they grow there is no costs associated to maintaining or replacing them, and no other competition pops up out of anywhere.

Retail investors get worked up over ER’s like this, but the institutional money that actually moves the stock price is looking farther out. 

If people think the EV industry is going to stay this deflated and tesla margins aren’t going back up then that implies most legacy automakers are going bankrupt. On the other hand, if this is a rut from high rate environments, then this ER doesn’t really matter. It’s a data point, but I wouldn’t base the future of tesla on this one report.",6

You are entitled to your opinion, but I have found mine nothing but comfortable and convenient. And because of the SuperCharging network I've never had a problem or worried about charging.

And it is that SuperCharging network that I see becoming a bit of a cash cow as all other EV manufacturers are switching to the Tesla plug. Which also means they will have to buy access to the api's needed to access the network, in addition to folks having to pay for the electricity and use of them to charge.

And while I have little respect for Musk, he does have a lot of smart people working for him especially in technology.  The AI they are building around the 'self-driving' feature only keeps getting better. Trust me, there was a time when I wouldn't let my hands get more than inch off the wheel. Now, though I tend to keep my hand resting on the wheel, I am comfortable with it driving on the high way and it is getting better on city streets.

Your presumption is wrong. I have and am in a leadership position. 

Let’s think this through. Just keep an open mind. 

How old is Tesla? Founded 2003. 

How old is Toyota ford and GM? Over ~100 years for ford and GM, Toyota a little less. 

Yet Tesla a company that is significantly younger than them is stealing sales from them. Look at model y sales in 2023. 

https://insideevs.com/news/706169/tesla-model-y-best-selling-car-2023/amp/

What were EVs before Tesla? Nothing. Prius and Nissan leaf was a joke. Everybody made fun of them. Now everyone is making electric cars. Tesla made that happen. 

They entered an unbelievably hard industry and completely changed the paradigm. GM, ford and toyota had all the money and brand name and yet never shifted to electric. 
It’s almost like this Elon guy has a track record of starting stuff (SpaceX, PayPal, Zip2,) and being successful with it. Pretty decent track record overall huh? Might be why he is so rich. 

With everything considered Tesla seems to have a track record of being successful with what they do. Again look at their impact on the car industry. 
The energy, robotics and FSD is extremely unbelievably early. Yet, you said it yourself, revenue growth within energy is great? So how about you give them a few more years? Try to think long term. 

It’s people like you who never had the vision to see them coming. Imagine if you invested in them in 2010, 2011, 2012 etc, instead of presuming failure and being a doubter haha.

They're kinda like if you had a translator for you and a person who didn't speak English, but the translator simply knows how to convert the words. They do not understand the speech. Therefore, there's no real intelligence.

Tech companies understand this, but also know how much money there is in ""AI"" right now, so they're not going to be as open about how this wasn't really an ""AI breakthrough""

The public did not, and does not understand this. They are expecting an AI explosion with robots bringing you beer during the football game. I do not believe this will happen anytime soon.

While opening them up is good for charging revenue, it democratizes the once exclusive Supercharger experience.

He had an invisible hand in the form of Gov to subsidize/support his companies, Tesla and SpaceX  both. SpaceX success is solely because of Gwynne, who is President and COO. She is the one who was able to earn those sweet Gov contracts which others had failed in private industry. Without that SpaceX was fucked.

Similarly US Gov introduced incentives and subsidies on electric vehicles which helped Tesla break cover.

And Elons contribution? He literally made production halt in factories of his genius ideas to fully automated and speed up his factories which led to several disruptions and his operations lead taking a leave for several months due to extreme stress. He also had engineers remove radars and move to pure vision for FSD, a disaster which has caused FSD to become most unreliable in the market right now.

It might suck , it might be great we dont know. But its silly to criticise the old/current version as AI when it has 0% AI and then new one is only AI.

Personally i dont like musk , only his SpaceX stuff, but i see the potential in wide-spread FSD since we sre getting rid of cars any time soon.

His FSD might be good might be shit, but in 30 years i guarantee some form of FSD will dominate.
Now i think the new FSD is probably gonna be alright but we have to see.",0
19bt9ji,TSLA Holders in 2024,2024-01-22 05:27:55,"> Toyota sells about ten times as many vehicles as Tesla. 

Yes, at a lower margin, because they aren’t benefiting from economies of scale of having a single model of vehicle.

Economies of scale are absolutely a factor because you have different parts for different models of cars. Do you really think Toyota prefers to sell dozens of different models of cars as opposed to fewer models?

> ￼ Economies of scale aren't a factor when you have multiple manufacturing plants.

I’m not sure what you think economies of scale means, but the number of manufacturing plants that you have isn’t really relevant. It’s the volume that’s relevant.",-1

Upgrading that infrastructure to support the demand of electric cars would be as big a project as building roads for cars. 

They can't scale. There's still room for growth in the market, but without massive government investment in infrastructure to support them, there is a cap on the amount of electric vehicles we can have going. 

That said, until recently(ish), China was the dark horse market. But now it doesn't particularly matter because Chinese manufacturers have stepped up their game and last I saw, Xi wasn't as big a fan of Elon anymore. 

Unless it's unclear, I think the entire EV market will crash eventually. Manufacturers hope nobody notices the stress on the grid until ownership is high enough to create demand for government investment and I think those hopes will be dashed like Psalm 137:9.",3

They lose too much money building them. The more they build, the more they lose.

19bt9ji,TSLA Holders in 2024,2024-01-21 23:34:17,"The ev market will be 80 % of auto production in the next 5 years.

The grid is fine. We're investing a trillion dollars a year into the grid. That doesn't include all the new wind and solar projects get interconnected.

Battery storage is nuts right now. One of the biggest reasons I own tesla stock.

We don't have shortages, ev prices are coming down really fast at tesla and byd.

You're right, the legacies can't scale, but byd and can and are aggressively. Tesla is still highly profitable as they drive cogs down every week. 

Everyone else minus the luxury brands are going to shrink and reorganize.

Tsla is going to rip when people see the margins aren't crushed during an economic slowdown.

I get that there is inertia, but there are still plenty of parts which are the same.",1
19bt9ji,TSLA Holders in 2024,2024-01-22 10:52:53,"That's the problem. It's not at all like building an ice auto.

Yes they also need to raise capital. Tesla started years ago and grew to be profitable. Legacies build less cars in a year combined than tesla does in a quarter.

Not looking good. The next 5 years are the most important, and legacies won't have the capability to build, nor the affordability.",1
