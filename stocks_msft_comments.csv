17t23sz,Taking out all my money from VOO and dumping it into MSFT,Just start investing in msft and dont dump your voo. Never touch that. Msft went down to 230 recently. Just create a position into if you want and dont be hasty. It will not just go up indefinitely,47

17t23sz,Taking out all my money from VOO and dumping it into MSFT,Why does it look almost certain? Because the stock price has gone up recently?

17t23sz,Taking out all my money from VOO and dumping it into MSFT,Lol. I do this but ppl in this forum will disagree. You have to trust your instincts and our own way. Asking ppl here is wrong,2
17t23sz,Taking out all my money from VOO and dumping it into MSFT,"I don‚Äôt care what this dude does with his portfolio. What bothers me are the wannabe Buffets talking about diversification as if you‚Äôre goal is to protect you‚Äôre $25 billion in cash from inflation or fluctuations. 

If you see an opportunity then concentrate your money into it. Unless of course you have tens of millions already, which then you would want to diversify to protect it. 

Stop giving people your bad advice, as if diversifying a portfolio magically makes you a millionaire when it‚Äôs only a wealth management tool.",4
17t23sz,Taking out all my money from VOO and dumping it into MSFT,"Assuming this is a serious question, there's obvious issues whether you do or you don't.  

I'm doubtful this is a true portfolio, as you'd need to have been doing a lot of active buying and selling to just happen on those very round numbers.  

It's also highly sector concentrated and thus non-diverse.  Plus there's redundancies in the fact VOO would contain all the individual names also.  

Essentially you'd be making a move that's traditionally not recommended, and for taking that risk, you only stand to potentially benefit a slice of a slice of increment.  And that's assuming it works out.  

That said, I'm an advocate of motivated and dedicated individuals holding a basket of individual stock names.  That absolutely can produce better results than indexes.  However it requires, as already mentioned, a lot of active management and attention and discipline and skill.  

You're essentially being your own fund manager at that point.  And it's like being a zookeeper.  No days off, ever.  Constant attention and researching and tracking.  Need to be available to make trades as required.  This amounts to a certain number of hours per day.  So if you're doing this so that your $10,000 portfolio can return $1,000 this year instead of $700, you might be spending 300 hours to (potentially) capture $300.  That's $1/hour for your time.

But if you're doing it on a $1 million portfolio, and it nets you $30,000 better results, that $30,000 for 300 hours is $100/hour.  At that scale, being your own full time fund manager becomes more compelling.",2
17t23sz,Taking out all my money from VOO and dumping it into MSFT,"I personally wouldn't recommend it.

Microsoft is a great company and I don't see them going bankrupt anytime soon, but due to the sky high valuation of MSFT the likliehood of it going higher and higher for the immediate future is low.

The diversification of VOO is great at maintaining value and being less volatile. Making MSFT 40% of your portfolio is a bit pigeon holed.

Also it looks like your individual holdings are just more SP500 heavyweights.

You might want to consider some diversification. 

If you want to stay US maybe look at an ETF for medium or small cap funds.

But if it were me, I'd say move the money from VOO to something like VXUS.

International is very undervalued relative to the US, meaning it has a greater likliehood of big gains in the long term.

Your individual holdings give you a lot of US exposure. So my one recommendation would quickly give you a global portfolio.",2

17t23sz,Taking out all my money from VOO and dumping it into MSFT,"I think there's more risk involved, but sometimes more risk = More gains.

Idc what the market is doing, or what people are saying in here. if you DCA with that set up you'll probably be up LONG TERM.

If it Moves sideways then good. APPL NVDA and MSFT pays dividends and usually increase them every year.

If any of them crash then good, everything is on sale, dividends will still build.

DCA and DRIP the divs and you'll be fine.

If it were me, I would go 50% VOO and the rest in APPL NVDA AND MSFT. Not a fan of Amazon and meta as companies. And they don't pay dividends.

Good luck IGNORE the noise. DCA regardless of price IF your goal is long term.",1

17t23sz,Taking out all my money from VOO and dumping it into MSFT,"MSFT is probably good for almost 500 and then back down. I‚Äôm guessing the likely range for MSFT in the next 3 years is 350-500. The up we‚Äôre seeing now with MSFT seems uncharacteristic for this time of year. 

MSFT has outperformed VOO in the previous 1-3-5-10 year ranges significantly, but we might be near the end of that. 

I‚Äôll be moving partly out of MSFT just beyond 400 to pay for a remodel, but I‚Äôll be holding the rest until I die.

VOO Holdings:

AAPL - 6.96%

MSFT - 6.49%

Googl - 2.15%

INTC - 0.41%

AMZN - 3.19%

On top of that, many of their products are continually getting worse instead better.

YouTube's recommendation are so terrible these days I've started using the algorithm-less subscriptions tab. Google Chrome lost it's best-in-class status 5+ years ago.

One of the things that fascinates me is how such a behemoth of a company grew to that size without making anything. I have never owned a physical product made by google. They are far from market leaders in the enterprise sector (AWS, Azure, Salesforce) but yet their business productivity suite continue to chug along. I have never paid for youtube and haven't paid a dime for my gmail account that is old enough to apply for a driver's license. It boggles my mind how much money a search engine, user data collection and targeted ad revenue can balloon. Truly some peak consumerism sht.

People have said I'm crazy for this take, but what would google do in a recession? A real recession or even prolonged stagflation. The first thing that falls is the advertising industry. If you think about it Google doesn't produce or own much of anything that isn't completely codependent on advertising revenue. People I've had this thought experiment with are quick to say that google owns the biggest media content platform ever. They aren't wrong, that ship could drink a lot of water before it would ever sink, but that platform has been a cash cow only by the merciful teet of advertising dollars. Google no doubt must know this. I think their recent initiative in attempt to get in on the short video format space that no one wants and even more recent initiative to convert users with Adblockers on youtube to convert them in to premium subscribers could be a tell future projections on what was once reliable revenue streams might be slowing down. By no means do I think google would be doomed they are a lot more than just youtube, but from an investing standpoint I could never justify entering a position after the great slingshot of covid 19.

Unless you are an ""insider"" you probably won't hear too much on these advancements, as big tech acquires most of these companies before they come to market for an end user.

If you want to look at what technologies AI is being used for, look no further than CIA funding. Palantir is a decent example of a CIA funded startup that is now publicly traded.

You can also look at a CIA finance arm's offerings [here](https://www.iqt.org/portfolio/). Occasionally looking at the startups there, a certain air of dystopian future can arise.

Big data, big analytics, and big surveillance are a despot's wet dream, and as more developing nations increase internet access for their populations, these tools will become even more pervasive.

Not all redundancies in big tech will come directly from AI, but automation of historically human jobs is certainly in the pipeline. One needs to look no further than their local supermarket in the western world to see machines fulfilling the past roles of cashiers. 

It is speculated that Microsoft is using individual user data to train it's [AI models](https://mspoweruser.com/personal-data-to-train-ai/) after a recent change in their privacy policy.

While we may not see the ramifications of these moves for a couple years, it's safe to assume that big tech wielding such an extensive collection of user data that can be parsed through AI models is going to be seriously fucking lucrative, likely at the expense of the general public.

If you want a glimpse of the dystopian promiseland envisioned by big tech and government, check out Henry Kissinger and former Google CEO Eric Schmidt's book ""The Age of AI.""

I'm bullish on individuals sacrificing their autonomy for convenience.",2

17fmkxr,MSFT Crushes Azure earnings up over 4% AH,"That is all nice, but it's not a monopoly or anywhere close no matter how you want to read the numbers. Even after the acquisition, it's not even in the neighborhood of becoming one.

Activision Blizzard King is not the ""primary supplier"" for the games sector. Far from it.

Microsoft is not having a monopoly position in any form in the gaming market. Their Xbox consoles are being outsold 2:1 by Sony and 4:1 by Nintendo. On PC their Xbox Store is so far behind Steam it's not even a competition, despite Microsoft pushing the Xbox app there directly in the OS.

On mobile Microsoft has almost no presence in gaming before they acquired King, which has the popular Candy Crush, but little else.

The gaming revenue from Microsoft is including multiplatform titles like Minecraft, which is by far their most played game.

Your numbers do not match up. You are comparing the ""global gaming console market"" and then throw in numbers from Microsoft at 16.3 billion which would include subscriptions, multiplatform sales and PC sales. And even in this example, Microsoft in 2022 was 40% behind PlayStation (which would mostly have console market revenue).

Just because a big company buys another big company doesn't mean it's a monopoly. You can have all sorts of criticism of course, but yours are just not valid and far removed from actual reality.",5

**Activision Blizzard Acquisition by Microsoft**  
Both the United States' Federal Trade Commission and the United Kingdom's Competition and Markets Authority challenged the merger as anticompetitive and initiated legal procedures in their respective countries. In the United States, the acquisition was reviewed by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), as the agency had raised more concerns over mergers and acquisitions in the Big Tech sector in the last decade. Some U.S. Senators also expressed their concerns about the merger to the FTC. As part of the FTC's investigation, it was stated that both companies have ""failed to protect the rights of consumers"" and that the merger should be opposed if ""the transaction is likely to enhance monopoly power, and also worsen the negotiating position between workers and the parties."" The FTC formally stated its intention to block the acquisition as proposed on December 8, 2022. The FTC expressed concern that the acquisition would harm consumers of Activision Blizzard's games, and give Microsoft too much control of certain parts of the industry, such as cloud gaming. The FTC also pointed to the acquisition of Zenimax, which the FTC claimed that Microsoft had agreed to a concession from the European Union to not make their games exclusive to the Xbox, and later broke.   
The courts granted the temporary restraining order on June 13, 2023, while a hearing to determine if a preliminary injunction on the deal should be granted was held from June 22 to 30, 2023, before Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley. Microsoft said that if the injunction should be granted, they may consider abandoning the deal which they described as being a ""three-year administrative nightmare"". During the hearing, the FTC was focused on the effect of Call of Duty in the competitive market, console exclusivity, and the impact of the nascent cloud gaming field.  
The FTC formally withdrew its challenge to the acquisition on July 20, 2023, though they have announced their intent to refile at a later time. The FTC reopened its case against the merger on September 27, 2023, but then declined to block the merger from occurring.",0

**Sony Earnings**   
Sony‚Äôs (NYSE: SONY) PlayStation division generated **$26.9 billion in revenue** throughout **FY221 (period ending 3/2022**). This was driven predominantly by PlayStation 5 console sales, which had shipped a strong 19 million units in FY221. The total cumulative PS5 sales by March 2023 were 38.4 million.  
Sony, the Japanese electronics and entertainment giant, Friday reported full year results for the 12-month period from April 2022 to March 2023 showing group sales rising 16% to JPY11.5 trillion in local currency terms and net profits up 6% to JPY937 billion. (Using current rates of exchange between the US dollar and the Japanese Yen, conglomerate-wide sales were **$85.1 billion and net profits $6.94 billion**).  
Sony‚Äôs ‚Äògames & network services‚Äô division managed a 33% leap in sales revenues from JPY2.74 trillion to JPY3.65 trillion, reflecting currency gains and increased hardware sales. ‚ÄúGod of War Ragnarok‚Äù was a highlight. Operating income dropped by 28%, hurt by cost for game development acquisition costs and fewer third-party games sales. The group is forecasting that GNS will be able to show 7-8% improvements in top and bottom lines in the 2023-24 financial year. **Sony‚Äôs ‚ÄòGames & Network Services‚Äô division reported a net profit of $3.22 billion in the fiscal year 2022**.",0
